# Lecture 23: Role of Values in Science: Epistemic and Non-Epistemic Values

## 1. Introduction

Science is often considered value-neutral — objective, free from values. But is this true? Do values play a role in science? If yes, when are they problematic and when necessary?

In this lecture, we will examine role of values in science: epistemic values (truth, accuracy, predictability) and non-epistemic values (ethical, political, economic), problem of value neutrality, and when values are problematic and when necessary.

**Lecture goal:** Understand role of values in science, difference between epistemic and non-epistemic values, and when values are appropriate and when problematic.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Values in Science

**Why is this important?**

Traditionally science is considered value-neutral:
- Science studies facts, not values
- Science is objective, free from values
- Values are domain of philosophy, ethics, politics

But is this true? Do values play a role in science?

**The Problem of Value Neutrality:**

**Position 1: Science is Value-Neutral (Logical Positivism)**
- Science studies facts, not values
- Values do not enter science
- Science is objective, free from values

**Position 2: Science is Value-Laden (Critics of Positivism)**
- Values influence science
- Choice of problems, methods, interpretation of results
- Science cannot be completely free from values

**Position 3: Values are Necessary in Science (Contemporary Approaches)**
- Epistemic values are necessary for science
- Non-epistemic values may be appropriate
- Question is which values and when

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Psychology studies humans — object of values
- Psychology has practical application
- Values influence choice of problems, methods, interpretation

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand role of values and their limitations.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Epistemic Values

**What are Epistemic Values?**

Epistemic values are values related to cognition, knowledge:
- **Truth:** correspondence to reality
- **Accuracy:** accuracy of description
- **Predictability:** ability to predict
- **Simplicity:** simplicity of explanation (parsimony)
- **Explanatory Power:** ability to explain
- **Empirical Support:** confirmation by data
- **Reproducibility:** possibility to reproduce

**Role of Epistemic Values:**

Epistemic values are necessary for science:
- **Choice of Problems:** what problems to study?
- **Choice of Methods:** what methods to use?
- **Evaluation of Theories:** which theories are better?
- **Interpretation of Results:** how to interpret data?

**Examples of Epistemic Values in Psychology:**

1. **Choice of Problems:**
   - Epistemic value: importance of problem for understanding
   - Example: studying important phenomena (memory, attention)

2. **Choice of Methods:**
   - Epistemic value: accuracy, reliability of methods
   - Example: choosing methods with high validity

3. **Evaluation of Theories:**
   - Epistemic value: explanatory power, simplicity
   - Example: preferring theories with greater explanatory power

**Problem:**

Epistemic values can conflict:
- **Truth vs. Simplicity:** complex theory may be more true
- **Accuracy vs. Predictability:** accurate description may not predict
- **Explanatory Power vs. Empirical Support:** theory may explain well, but have little support

**Literature:**
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962, Russian trans. 2003)
  - On role of values in science

### 3.2. Non-Epistemic Values

**What are Non-Epistemic Values?**

Non-epistemic values are values not related to cognition:
- **Ethical Values:** morality, justice, good
- **Political Values:** freedom, equality, democracy
- **Economic Values:** efficiency, profit, growth
- **Social Values:** well-being, health, development
- **Cultural Values:** traditions, identity

**Role of Non-Epistemic Values:**

Non-epistemic values also influence science:
- **Choice of Problems:** what problems are important? (ethical, social)
- **Funding:** what is funded? (economic, political)
- **Application of Results:** how are results used? (ethical, social)

**Examples of Non-Epistemic Values in Psychology:**

1. **Choice of Problems:**
   - Ethical value: studying important social problems
   - Example: studying poverty, inequality, discrimination

2. **Funding:**
   - Economic value: funding practical research
   - Example: funding research on therapy, education

3. **Application of Results:**
   - Social value: application to improve well-being
   - Example: application to therapy, education, social programs

**Problem:**

Non-epistemic values can distort science:
- **Political Values:** can influence interpretation of results
- **Economic Values:** can influence choice of problems
- **Cultural Values:** can influence theoretical preferences

**Literature:**
- **Helen Longino, "Science as Social Knowledge"** (1990, English)
  - On role of non-epistemic values in science

### 3.3. Problem of Value Neutrality

**Position 1: Science is Value-Neutral (Logical Positivism)**

**Arguments:**
- Science studies facts, not values
- Values do not enter science
- Science is objective, free from values
- Values are domain of philosophy, ethics

**Problems:**
- But values influence science (choice of problems, methods)
- Epistemic values necessary for science
- Complete value neutrality impossible

**Position 2: Science is Value-Laden (Critics of Positivism)**

**Arguments:**
- Values influence all stages of science
- Choice of problems depends on values
- Interpretation of results depends on values
- Complete value neutrality impossible

**Problems:**
- But this does not mean arbitrariness
- Can minimize influence of non-epistemic values
- Epistemic values guide science

**Position 3: Values are Necessary, but Need to Distinguish (Contemporary Approaches)**

**Arguments:**
- Epistemic values necessary for science
- Non-epistemic values may be appropriate
- Important to distinguish appropriate and inappropriate values
- Need criteria for evaluating values

**Problems:**
- How to distinguish appropriate and inappropriate values?
- What criteria to use?
- Who decides?

**Literature:**
- **Helen Longino, "Science as Social Knowledge"** (1990, English)
  - On problem of value neutrality

### 3.4. When are Values Problematic, When Necessary?

**Epistemic Values: Necessary**

Epistemic values necessary for science:
- **Without Epistemic Values There is No Science:**
  - No criteria for choosing problems, methods, theories
  - No direction for development of science

**Examples:**
- Truth necessary for evaluating theories
- Accuracy necessary for validity of results
- Predictability necessary for testing theories

**Non-Epistemic Values: Appropriate vs. Problematic**

**Appropriate Non-Epistemic Values:**

1. **Choice of Problems:**
   - Ethical values appropriate when choosing important problems
   - Example: studying poverty, inequality

2. **Funding:**
   - Social values appropriate when prioritizing funding
   - Example: funding research on health, education

3. **Application of Results:**
   - Ethical values appropriate when applying results
   - Example: ethical application of psychological knowledge

**Problematic Non-Epistemic Values:**

1. **Distortion of Data:**
   - Non-epistemic values should not distort data
   - Example: fitting data to political goals

2. **Distortion of Interpretation:**
   - Non-epistemic values should not distort interpretation
   - Example: political interpretation of results

3. **Ignoring Alternatives:**
   - Non-epistemic values should not ignore alternatives
   - Example: ignoring alternative explanations due to political preferences

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Do They Distort Data:**
   - Should not fit data to values
   - Example: not distort results

2. **Do They Distort Interpretation:**
   - Should not distort interpretation
   - Example: not ignore alternative interpretations

3. **Do They Ignore Alternatives:**
   - Should not ignore alternatives
   - Example: consider different viewpoints

**Literature:**
- **Helen Longino, "The Fate of Knowledge"** (2002, English)
  - On criteria for evaluating values in science

### 3.5. Examples from Psychology

**Example 1: Intelligence Research**

**Values in Choice of Problems:**
- Ethical values: is studying intelligence important?
- Social values: how are results used?

**Values in Interpretation:**
- Political values: interpretation of group differences
- Ethical values: interpretation of heritability

**Problem:**
- Values can distort interpretation
- Example: using results to justify inequality

**Example 2: Gender Research**

**Values in Choice of Problems:**
- Political values: importance of studying gender
- Ethical values: focus on equality

**Values in Interpretation:**
- Political values: interpretation of differences
- Ethical values: accounting for social context

**Problem:**
- Values can influence interpretation of differences
- Example: emphasis on differences vs. similarities

**Example 3: Therapy Research**

**Values in Choice of Problems:**
- Ethical values: importance of effective therapy
- Social values: accessibility of therapy

**Values in Application:**
- Ethical values: ethical application of therapy
- Social values: fair distribution

**Problem:**
- Values can influence evaluation of effectiveness
- Example: preference for certain therapy methods

**Literature:**
- **Stephen Jay Gould, "The Mismeasure of Man"** (1981, English, Russian trans. 2014)
  - On values in intelligence research

### Practical Assignments

1. Analyze specific study:
   - Which values influence study?
   - Epistemic or non-epistemic?
   - Are they appropriate or problematic?

2. Analyze choice of problem:
   - Which values influence choice of problem?
   - Epistemic or non-epistemic?
   - How do they influence?

3. Analyze interpretation of results:
   - Which values influence interpretation?
   - Do they distort interpretation?
   - How to minimize distortions?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Weber's work "Science as Vocation and Profession" — this is a classic work on value neutrality of science. Then study Longino's work "Science as Social Knowledge" — it shows role of non-epistemic values. Consider examples from psychology (Gould on intelligence) — they show influence of values in practice.
