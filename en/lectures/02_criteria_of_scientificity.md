# Lecture 2: Criteria of Scientificity: What Makes Science Science?

## 1. Introduction

What makes science science? How to distinguish a scientific theory from a non-scientific one? Why is astrology not a science, while astronomy is a science? Why does psychoanalysis spark debates about its scientific status?

These are fundamental questions of philosophy of science, known as the **demarcation problem** — distinguishing science from non-science. Solving this problem is important for understanding psychology methodology.

In this lecture, we will examine the main criteria of scientificity proposed by philosophers of science in the 20th century: **verificationism**, **Popper's falsificationism**, and **Lakatos's methodology of research programs**. We will analyze their applicability to psychology and the problems they create.

**Lecture goal:** Understand what makes a theory scientific, what criteria of scientificity exist, and how they are applicable (or inapplicable) to psychology.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Demarcation Problem

**Why is this important?**

In the 19th century, psychology emerged as a separate discipline, separating from philosophy. From the very beginning, a question arose: Is psychology a science? And if yes, what makes it a science?

**Classical problems:**

1. **Verificationism:** Can we verify psychological theories through observation? Many psychological theories (for example, about the unconscious) are not directly verifiable.

2. **Popper's Falsificationism:** Can we falsify psychological theories? Some theories (for example, psychoanalysis) are considered non-falsifiable.

3. **Progressiveness (Lakatos):** Do psychological programs develop progressively? Or do they only defend themselves against anomalies?

**The Problem of Pseudoscience:**

It is important to distinguish:
- **Science:** physics, chemistry, biology, psychology (with reservations)
- **Pseudoscience:** astrology, alchemy, phrenology
- **Protoscience:** predecessors of science that do not yet have full scientific status

How to distinguish psychology from pseudoscience? For example, psychoanalysis: science or pseudoscience?

**The Problem of Criteria:**

Different areas of science use different methods:
- Physics: experiment, mathematical modeling
- Biology: observation, experiment, comparative analysis
- History: interpretation of documents
- Psychology: experiment, survey, observation, interpretation

Are the same criteria of scientificity applicable to all sciences? Or does each science have its own criteria?

**The Problem of Scientific Development:**

Science develops: theories are replaced by new theories. How to assess whether science is progressing? The classical criterion: new theories explain more facts than old ones. But in psychology, old theories are not always replaced by new ones — they can coexist. Does this mean that psychology is not progressing?

These problems do not have simple answers. Various philosophers of science proposed different criteria. Let's consider the main approaches.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Logical Positivism and Verificationism

**Main Idea:**

Logical positivism (Vienna Circle, 1920s-1930s) believed that a scientific statement must be **verifiable** — testable through observation. Only statements that can be verified empirically have meaning. Everything else is metaphysics, without scientific significance.

**Criterion of Verifiability:**

A statement is scientific if it can be verified through observation. For example:
- "All metals expand when heated" — can be verified by experiment
- "God exists" — cannot be verified by observation, therefore meaningless

**Problems of Verificationism:**

1. **Problem of Induction:** Observing specific cases does not prove a general statement. Observing that many metals expand does not prove that *all* metals expand.

2. **Theoretical Terms:** Many scientific terms cannot be reduced to observations (for example, "electron", "unconscious"). How to verify them?

3. **Universal Laws:** Universal statements ("all X are Y") cannot be fully verified, as it would require checking an infinite number of cases.

**Applicability to Psychology:**

Verificationism creates problems for psychology:
- How to verify statements about the unconscious if it is unobservable?
- How to verify internal states (thoughts, feelings)?
- Psychological theories often use theoretical constructs that cannot be reduced to observations.

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005) — chapter 1, paragraphs 1-4: critique of verificationism
- **Alfred Ayer, "Language, Truth and Logic"** (1936, Engl. trans. 1999) — chapter 1: criterion of verifiability
- **Rudolf Carnap, "Philosophical Foundations of Physics"** (1966, Engl. trans. 1971) — chapter 1: on verifiability in science

### 3.2. Karl Popper's Falsificationism

**Popper's Main Idea:**

Popper criticized verificationism and proposed an alternative: **falsificationism**. A scientific theory should not be verifiable, but should be **falsifiable** — that is, it should make predictions that can be refuted by observation.

**Criterion of Falsifiability:**

A theory is scientific if it makes **falsifiable predictions** — predictions that can be refuted by empirical data.

Examples:
- "All swans are white" — falsifiable (enough to find a black swan)
- "God exists" — non-falsifiable (how to refute?)
- "The unconscious determines behavior" — non-falsifiable (any behavior can be explained through the unconscious)

**Science vs. Pseudoscience:**

- **Scientific theory:** makes risky predictions that can be refuted
- **Pseudoscience:** does not make falsifiable predictions, explains everything post hoc

For example, astrology explains any events post hoc ("Mars in retrograde explains your problems"), but does not make falsifiable predictions.

**Process of Scientific Research According to Popper:**

1. **Problem:** observation of an anomaly contradicting an existing theory
2. **Hypothesis:** formulation of a new theory that solves the problem
3. **Falsification:** attempt to refute the theory by testing its predictions
4. **Evaluation:** if predictions are refuted, the theory is falsified; if not, the theory is temporarily accepted

**Role of Empirics:**

According to Popper, empirical data do not **confirm** a theory (this is impossible due to the problem of induction), but **do not refute** it. A theory that has withstood attempts at falsification is considered **corroborated** (supported), but not true.

**Problems of Falsificationism:**

1. **Problem of Basic Statements:** What counts as "observation"? Observations are theory-laden — they depend on theories.

2. **Theories Are Not Refuted Alone:** When testing a theory, not only the theory itself is tested, but also auxiliary hypotheses, methods, instruments (Duhem-Quine thesis).

3. **Defense of Theories:** Scientists defend theories from falsification by changing auxiliary hypotheses, not by discarding the theory.

4. **Problem of Applicability to Psychology:** Many psychological theories are difficult to falsify (for example, psychoanalysis). Is this a problem of the theory or the criterion?

**Applicability to Psychology:**

Falsificationism creates problems:
- Many psychological theories (psychoanalysis, personality theories) are difficult to falsify
- Psychological phenomena depend on context, which complicates testing predictions
- Ethical limitations make it difficult to falsify some theories

**Examples from Psychology:**

**Falsifiable Theories:**
- Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger): predicts that under dissonance people will change beliefs or behavior
- Reinforcement theory (Skinner): predicts that behavior depends on reinforcement
- Social learning theory (Bandura): predicts that observation affects behavior

**Difficult to Falsify Theories:**
- Psychoanalysis: any data can be interpreted as confirmation
- Personality theories: use vague predictions
- Cultural-historical approach: difficult to test in experiment

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 1, paragraphs 1-4: criterion of falsifiability
  - Chapter 2, paragraphs 20-22: demarcation problem
  - Chapter 4, paragraphs 30-33: corroboration

  - Introduction: critique of Popper's naive falsificationism

### 3.3. Imre Lakatos's Methodology of Research Programs

**Critique of Popper:**

Lakatos criticized Popper's naive falsificationism. In real science, theories are not discarded at the first anomaly. Scientists defend theories by changing auxiliary hypotheses. Moreover, theories are refuted not individually, but as part of **research programs**.

**Lakatos's Main Idea:**

Science develops through **research programs** — sequences of theories connected by common principles. One should evaluate not individual theories, but programs as a whole.

**Structure of a Research Program:**

1. **Hard core:** irrefutable assumptions of the program. If the hard core is rejected, the program ceases to exist.

2. **Protective belt:** auxiliary hypotheses that can be changed to protect the program from anomalies.

3. **Positive heuristics:** rules for directing research — what to study, how to develop theory.

4. **Negative heuristics:** rules for protecting the hard core — what cannot be done so as not to reject the core.

**Examples of Research Programs:**

**Behaviorist Program:**
- **Hard core:** behavior is determined by environment through reinforcement
- **Protective belt:** specific mechanisms of reinforcement (positive, negative, punishment, reinforcement schedules)
- **Positive heuristics:** study the connection between stimulus and response, experiment
- **Negative heuristics:** do not study internal processes, do not use introspection

**Cognitive Program:**
- **Hard core:** mind processes information; can be studied indirectly
- **Protective belt:** specific processing models (Atkinson-Shiffrin model, Treisman's attention model)
- **Positive heuristics:** develop processing models, experiment
- **Negative heuristics:** do not consider the mind a "black box", do not ignore internal processes

**Evaluation of a Program:**

**Progressive Program:**
- Predicts new facts
- Expands, explains more phenomena
- Defense against anomalies leads to new predictions

**Degenerative Program:**
- Only explains the known post hoc
- Narrows, explains fewer phenomena
- Defense against anomalies does not lead to new predictions

**Example:**

Behaviorism in the 1920s-1950s was a progressive program: it predicted new reinforcement effects. By the 1960s it became degenerative: it could not explain language behavior, cognitive processes; it only defended itself with ad hoc hypotheses.

**Applicability to Psychology:**

Lakatos's methodology better describes the development of psychology:
- Psychology develops through research programs, not individual theories
- Programs defend themselves against anomalies by changing the protective belt
- Several programs coexist simultaneously

**Problems:**

1. **When to Reject a Program?** Lakatos does not provide clear criteria. A degenerative program can become progressive.

2. **Simultaneous Existence of Programs:** In psychology, several programs coexist. How to compare them?

3. **Integration of Programs:** Can different programs be integrated? Lakatos believed that programs are incommensurable.

  - On rational evaluation of research programs

### 3.4. Alternative Criteria and Modern Approaches

**Pragmatic Approach:**

Some philosophers believe that criteria of scientificity are not universal. Different areas of science have different criteria depending on:
- **Object of study:** physical objects vs. living beings vs. humans
- **Methods:** experiment vs. observation vs. interpretation
- **Goals:** prediction vs. explanation vs. understanding

**Criteria of Scientificity in Psychology:**

One can propose criteria specific to psychology:
1. **Systematicity:** theory must be systematic, not random
2. **Empirical Justification:** theory must be based on data
3. **Explanatory Power:** theory must explain phenomena
4. **Practical Applicability:** theory must have practical applications (this is especially important for psychology)
5. **Critical Discussion:** theory must be subject to community critique

**Problem:** These criteria are too broad — many non-scientific theories fit them.

**Postmodern Approach:**

Postmodernists (Feyerabend) criticize the idea of unified criteria of scientificity:
- **"Anything goes"** — any methods are acceptable
- There are no universal criteria of scientificity
- Science develops through "anarchism", not rules

**Problem:** This leads to relativism — there are no criteria for distinguishing between science and non-scientific practices.

  - Chapter 1: critique of unified methodological rules
  - Chapter 17: "Anything goes"

## 4. Conclusions

**Key Ideas of the Lecture:**

1. **The Demarcation Problem** — distinguishing science from non-science — is fundamental to psychology methodology.

2. **Classical Criteria of Scientificity:**
   - **Verificationism:** scientific statement must be verifiable through observation
   - **Popper's Falsificationism:** scientific theory must make falsifiable predictions
   - **Lakatos's Methodology:** science develops through research programs that can be progressive or degenerative

3. **Each Approach Has Problems:**
   - Verificationism: problem of induction, theoretical terms
   - Falsificationism: problem of basic statements, defense of theories
   - Lakatos's methodology: unclear criteria for rejecting programs

4. **Applicability to Psychology:**
   - Falsificationism creates problems: many psychological theories are difficult to falsify
   - Lakatos's methodology better describes the development of psychology through programs
   - Some psychological theories (psychoanalysis) spark debates about scientific status

5. **No Universal Criteria:**
   - Different areas of science may have different criteria
   - Criteria can change over time
   - Critical discussion is important, not strict rules

**Practical Conclusions:**

1. **Critical Approach:** Do not accept theories on faith. Ask: can they be tested? Do they make predictions?

2. **Understanding Foundations:** Understand the grounds on which a theory is considered scientific. This will help assess its limitations.

3. **Evaluation of Programs:** Evaluate not individual theories, but research programs as a whole. Are they progressive or degenerative?

4. **Methodological Pluralism:** In psychology, there can be several scientific approaches simultaneously. This is not necessarily a problem, but a feature of the discipline.

## 5. Problems

**Open Questions:**

1. **Is Psychoanalysis a Science?**
   - Popper's position: no, it is non-falsifiable
   - Alternative position: it is falsifiable, but in a different sense (through clinical data)
   - Problem: how to evaluate the scientific status of psychoanalytic theory?

2. **Can Popper's Criteria Be Applied to Psychology?**
   - Many psychological theories are difficult to falsify
   - Is this a problem of the theory or the criterion?
   - Does psychology need its own criteria of scientificity?

3. **How to Assess Whether Psychology Is Progressing?**
   - In psychology, several programs coexist simultaneously
   - There is no single dominant program
   - Does this mean that psychology is not progressing?

4. **Are Universal Criteria of Scientificity Needed?**
   - Position 1: yes, they help distinguish science from pseudoscience
   - Position 2: no, different areas have different criteria
   - Position 3: criteria are important, but they should be flexible

**Practical Problems:**

1. **How to Evaluate the Scientific Status of a New Theory?**
   - Does it make predictions?
   - Can it be tested?
   - Does it explain phenomena?

2. **How to Distinguish Science from Pseudoscience in Psychology?**
   - Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP): science or pseudoscience?
   - Coaching based on psychological theories: is it scientific?
   - Popular psychology: where is the boundary with science?

3. **The Problem of Applying Criteria:**
   - Criteria of scientificity are often applied post hoc
   - During research, criteria may be unclear
   - How to apply criteria in real research?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** The goal is not to find the "correct" answer, but to learn to think critically about criteria of scientificity, to understand their foundations and limitations.

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose a psychological theory and analyze it from the perspective of Popper's criteria:
   - Is it falsifiable?
   - Does it make predictions?
   - What data could refute it?

2. Choose a psychological research program and analyze it according to Lakatos's scheme:
   - Hard core of the program
   - Protective belt
   - Positive and negative heuristics
   - Is it progressive or degenerative?

3. Find an example of pseudoscience in psychology and explain why it is not science according to Popper's or Lakatos's criteria.

**Recommendation:** Start by reading chapter 1 from Popper's "The Logic of Scientific Discovery" — this is a classic exposition of the criterion of falsifiability. Then read Lakatos's work "Falsification and Methodology" — it gives a more realistic description of the development of science.
