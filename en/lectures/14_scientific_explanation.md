# Lecture 14: Scientific Explanation and the Problem of Interpretation

## 1. Introduction

What does it mean to "explain" an event in psychology? How are psychological phenomena explained? What models of scientific explanation exist? And most importantly — how does the problem of interpretation affect scientific explanation?

In this lecture, we will examine models of scientific explanation (Hempel's deductive-nomological model, pragmatic model, mechanistic model), the problem of interpretation in scientific explanation, and how different approaches solve the problem of interpretation.

**Lecture goal:** Understand how scientific explanation works in psychology, various models of explanation, and the problem of interpretation in explanation.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Scientific Explanation in Psychology

**Why is this important?**

Explanation is one of the main goals of science. We want not just to describe events, but to understand why they occur. But what does it mean to "explain" in psychology?

**The Problem of Defining Explanation:**

**Simple Definitions:**
- To explain = to give answer to question "why?"
- But which answers are considered explanations?

**Scientific Explanation:**
- Explanation through cause? (X → Y)
- Explanation through law? (Y because law L)
- Explanation through mechanism? (Y because mechanism M)

**The Problem of Interpretation:**

Explanation requires interpretation:
- Interpretation of data depends on theory
- Interpretation of behavior depends on context
- Interpretation of experiences depends on language and culture

But if interpretation is subjective, how is objective explanation possible?

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many events require interpretation (behavior, experiences)
- Different approaches give different explanations of the same events
- How to choose correct explanation?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different models of explanation give different answers. It is important to understand various models and their limitations.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Deductive-Nomological Model (Hempel)

**Hempel's Main Idea:**

Scientific explanation is deductive inference of event from laws and initial conditions. Explanation shows that event followed from laws.

**Structure of Explanation (D-N Model):**

```
Laws (L1, L2, ...)
+
Initial Conditions (C1, C2, ...)
↓
Deductive Inference
↓
Explained Event (E)
```

**Example of Explanation:**

**Explanation:** Why did metal expand when heated?

**Structure:**
- **Law:** All metals expand when heated
- **Initial Condition:** This is metal, it was heated
- **Conclusion:** Metal expanded

**Characteristics of D-N Model:**

1. **Deductiveness:** explanation must be deductive inference
   - Event logically follows from laws and conditions

2. **Nomologicality:** explanation requires laws
   - Not just causality, but laws

3. **Necessity:** explanation shows necessity of event
   - Event had to occur under given conditions

**Problems of D-N Model:**

1. **Problem of Laws in Psychology:**
   - Are there universal laws in psychology?
   - Psychological patterns are contextual
   - Example: "all people..." — but there are exceptions

2. **Problem of Asymmetry:**
   - D-N model does not distinguish explanation and prediction
   - But explanation and prediction are different
   - Example: can predict without explaining

3. **Problem of Relevance:**
   - Not all deductive inferences are explanations
   - Need relevance
   - Example: can deduce from irrelevant laws

**Applicability to Psychology:**

D-N model is problematic for psychology:
- Psychology has few universal laws
- Psychological events are contextual
- But model can work for simple cases

**Literature:**
- **Carl Hempel, "Philosophy of Natural Science"** (1966, English, Russian trans. 1968)
  - Chapter 1: "Aspects of Scientific Explanation" — classic D-N model
- **Carl Hempel, Paul Oppenheim, "The Logic of Explanation"** (1948, English, Russian trans. in "Philosophy of Science", 1996)
  - Original work on D-N model

### 3.2. Pragmatic Model of Explanation

**Main Idea:**

Explanation is answer to question "why?". What is considered explanation depends on context, interests, knowledge of questioner.

**Characteristics of Pragmatic Model:**

1. **Contextuality:** explanation depends on context
   - Example: "Why did cup break?" — answer depends on context

2. **Relevance:** explanation must be relevant for questioner
   - Example: relevant answer depends on what questioner already knows

3. **Pragmaticity:** explanation must be useful
   - Example: explanation must help understand, predict, control

**Examples of Pragmatic Explanations:**

1. **"Why is person aggressive?"**
   - **Context 1:** Biological — explanation through neurotransmitters
   - **Context 2:** Psychological — explanation through cognitive schemas
   - **Context 3:** Social — explanation through social factors

2. **"Why anxiety?"**
   - **Context 1:** Clinical — explanation through symptoms, causes
   - **Context 2:** Theoretical — explanation through theory
   - **Context 3:** Practical — explanation through what helps

**Pros of Pragmatic Model:**

1. **Flexibility:** explanation depends on context, which is more realistic

2. **Relevance:** considers interests and knowledge of questioner

3. **Applicability:** more applicable to psychology, where events are contextual

**Cons of Pragmatic Model:**

1. **Relativism:** explanation depends on context, which may lead to relativism

2. **Subjectivity:** explanation is subjective, depends on questioner

3. **Difficulty of Evaluation:** how to evaluate quality of explanation if it is subjective?

**Literature:**
- **Bas van Fraassen, "The Scientific Image"** (1980, English, Russian trans. 2020)
  - On pragmatic model of explanation

### 3.3. Mechanistic Model (Explanation Through Mechanisms)

**Main Idea:**

Explanation is description of causal mechanisms that produce event. Not just laws, but mechanisms.

**Characteristics of Mechanistic Model:**

1. **Mechanism:** explanation describes mechanism of action
   - Example: how X leads to Y

2. **Causality:** explanation describes causal connections
   - Example: cause-effect connections

3. **Concreteness:** explanation is concrete, describes specific mechanisms
   - Example: not just "X → Y", but "X through mechanism M → Y"

**Examples of Mechanistic Explanations:**

1. **Explanation of Fear:**
   - **Mechanism:** amygdala activates → adrenaline release → physiological reactions → avoidance behavior
   - **Causal Connections:** each stage causes next

2. **Explanation of Memory:**
   - **Mechanism:** encoding → storage → retrieval
   - **Causal Connections:** encoding determines storage, storage determines retrieval

**Pros of Mechanistic Model:**

1. **Concreteness:** explanation is concrete, describes mechanisms

2. **Causality:** shows causal connections

3. **Applicability:** applicable to psychology, where understanding mechanisms is important

**Cons of Mechanistic Model:**

1. **Complexity:** mechanisms may be complex, difficult to describe

2. **Multiplicity:** there may be multiple mechanisms

3. **Testing:** difficult to test mechanisms

**Literature:**
- **Stuart Glennan, "Mechanisms and the Nature of Causation"** (1996, English)
  - On mechanistic explanation
- **Ronald Giere, "Explaining Science"** (1988, English)
  - On causal mechanisms as basis of explanation

### 3.4. The Problem of Interpretation in Explanation

**Main Problem:**

Explanation requires interpretation of data, behavior, experiences. But interpretation is subjective — depends on theory, context, interpreter.

**1. Interpretation of Data Depends on Theory**

**Problem:**

Same data can be interpreted differently depending on theory:
- **Theory 1:** data interpreted as confirmation of theory
- **Theory 2:** same data interpreted as confirmation of different theory

**Example:** Milgram Experiment (Obedience to Authority)
- **Data:** 65% of participants continued administering shocks to the end
- **Interpretation 1 (Authority):** people tend to obey authority
- **Interpretation 2 (Situation):** situational factors influence behavior
- **Interpretation 3 (Norms):** people follow social norms

Same data, different interpretations, different explanations.

**2. Interpretation of Behavior Depends on Context**

**Problem:**

Behavior is interpreted differently depending on context:
- **Context 1:** behavior interpreted as X
- **Context 2:** same behavior interpreted as Y

**Example:** Avoidance of Public Speaking
- **Context 1 (Cognitive):** interpreted as irrational beliefs
- **Context 2 (Psychodynamic):** interpreted as unacknowledged conflicts
- **Context 3 (Biological):** interpreted as physiological reactions

Different contexts, different interpretations, different explanations.

**3. Interpretation of Experiences Depends on Language and Culture**

**Problem:**

Experiences are interpreted through language, which depends on culture:
- **Language 1:** experience described as X
- **Language 2:** same experience described as Y

**Example:** Experience of Sadness
- **English Language:** "sadness"
- **Russian Language:** "грусть", "печаль", "тоска"
- **Other Languages:** other concepts

Different languages, different interpretations, different explanations.

**The Problem of Objectivity:**

If interpretation is subjective, how is objective explanation possible?
- **Position 1:** Explanation is always subjective, no objectivity
- **Position 2:** Can minimize subjectivity through criteria
- **Position 3:** Interpretation is subjective, but explanation can be objective

**Literature:**
- **Norwood Hanson, "Patterns of Discovery"** (1958, English)
  - On theoretical loading of observations
- **Willard Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"** (1951, English, Russian trans. in "Philosophy of Science", 1996)
  - On theoretical loading

### 3.5. Examples of Interpretation in Psychology

**Example 1: Cognitivism vs. Behaviorism**

**Data:** Rat presses lever, receives food, repeats behavior

**Behaviorist Explanation:**
- **Interpretation:** stimulus (food) → reaction (pressing lever)
- **Explanation:** behavior caused by reinforcement
- **Mechanism:** reinforcement strengthens stimulus-reaction connection

**Cognitive Explanation:**
- **Interpretation:** rat processes information about connection between action and result
- **Explanation:** behavior caused by cognitive processes
- **Mechanism:** cognitive processes process information

**Same data, different interpretations, different explanations.**

**Example 2: Cognitive vs. Psychodynamic Interpretation**

**Data:** Patient avoids public speaking

**Cognitive Interpretation:**
- **Interpretation:** irrational beliefs ("I will look stupid")
- **Explanation:** cognitive schemas cause avoidance
- **Mechanism:** dysfunctional schemas → irrational beliefs → avoidance

**Psychodynamic Interpretation:**
- **Interpretation:** unacknowledged conflicts (fear of judgment as projection of internal critic)
- **Explanation:** unconscious processes cause avoidance
- **Mechanism:** unacknowledged conflicts → defense mechanisms → avoidance

**Same data, different interpretations, different explanations.**

**The Problem of Choice:**

How to choose correct interpretation?
- **Criterion 1:** Predictive Power — which interpretation better predicts?
- **Criterion 2:** Therapeutic Effectiveness — which interpretation more effective?
- **Criterion 3:** Parsimony — which interpretation simpler?
- **Criterion 4:** Community Agreement — which interpretation does community agree with?

But all criteria are problematic.

**Literature:**
- **Adolf Grünbaum, "The Foundations of Psychoanalysis"** (1984, English)
  - On problem of interpretation in psychoanalysis

## 4. Conclusions

**Key Ideas of the Lecture:**

1. **Three Models of Explanation:**
   - **D-N Model (Hempel):** deductive inference from laws
   - **Pragmatic Model:** answer to question "why?" in context
   - **Mechanistic Model:** description of causal mechanisms

2. **Characteristics of Models:**
   - **D-N Model:** requires laws, deductive, but problematic for psychology
   - **Pragmatic Model:** contextual, relevant, but may be relativist
   - **Mechanistic Model:** describes mechanisms, concrete, but may be complex

3. **Problem of Interpretation:**
   - Interpretation of data depends on theory
   - Interpretation of behavior depends on context
   - Interpretation of experiences depends on language and culture
   - This creates problem of objectivity of explanation

4. **Examples:**
   - Cognitivism vs. Behaviorism — different interpretations of same data
   - Cognitive vs. Psychodynamic — different interpretations of same behavior

5. **Problem of Choice:**
   - How to choose correct interpretation?
   - Different criteria give different answers
   - Problem has no simple solution

**Practical Conclusions:**

1. **Understanding Models:** Understanding various models of explanation helps evaluate explanations

2. **Awareness of Interpretation Problem:** Important to be aware that explanation requires interpretation

3. **Critical Approach:** Important to critically evaluate explanations, considering interpretation

4. **Contextuality:** Important to consider contextuality of explanations

### Practical Assignments

1. Analyze a specific psychological explanation:
   - Which model of explanation does it use?
   - What interpretation is used?
   - What problems does explanation have?

2. Compare different explanations of one event:
   - How do they differ?
   - What interpretations are used?
   - How to choose between them?

3. Try to explain an event in different ways:
   - D-N model
   - Pragmatic model
   - Mechanistic model
   - Compare explanations

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Hempel's work "Philosophy of Natural Science" — this is a classic work on D-N model of explanation. Then study pragmatic model (van Fraassen) and mechanistic model (Giere) — they show alternatives to D-N model.
