# Lecture 4: Theory, Empirics, Method — Scientific Triptych

## 1. Introduction

How are theory, empirics, and method related? What comes first? Can we collect facts without theory? Does method determine theory or does theory determine method? These questions are fundamental to understanding psychology methodology.

In this lecture, we will examine three main components of scientific knowledge: **theory**, **empirics**, and **method**. We will analyze their interconnections, problems of each component, and how they work together in psychological research.

**Lecture goal:** Understand the structure of scientific knowledge, interconnections between theory, empirics, and method, and problems of each component.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Interconnection Between Theory, Empirics, and Method

**Why is this important?**

In science, there are three main components:
- **Theory:** system of concepts, laws, models
- **Empirics:** observations, data, facts
- **Method:** ways of obtaining data, research techniques

How are they related? What comes first? These are fundamental questions of methodology.

**The Problem of Priority:**

**Position 1: Empirics is Primary (Empiricism)**
- First we collect facts, then we build theories
- Theories are derived from observations (induction)
- Problem: can we collect facts without theory? What counts as a fact?

**Position 2: Theory is Primary (Rationalism)**
- First we build theories, then we verify them with facts
- Theories precede observations
- Problem: where do theories come from? How to verify them without data?

**Position 3: Method is Primary (Instrumentalism)**
- Method determines what we can know
- Different methods give different knowledge
- Problem: method depends on theory, theory depends on method

**The Problem of Circularity:**

Theory, empirics, and method are interdependent:
- **Theory** is needed to know what to observe (what counts as a fact)
- **Empirics** is needed to verify theory (data for verification)
- **Method** is needed to obtain data (research techniques)
- But method depends on theory (what do we want to know?), theory depends on empirics (what facts need to be explained?)

This creates a **hermeneutic circle** in science: it is impossible to start without all components, but all components depend on each other.

**The Problem of Theory-Ladenness of Observations:**

Observations are not neutral — they are theory-laden:
- What we see depends on our theories
- The same data can be interpreted differently
- "Pure facts" do not exist — facts are always interpreted

**Example:** Two researchers look at the same behavior:
- Behaviorist sees: stimulus → response
- Cognitivist sees: information processing, schemas, models

Same data, different interpretations.

**The Problem of Method:**

Method depends on:
- **Theory:** what do we want to know? What hypotheses are we testing?
- **Empirics:** what data are available? What can be observed?
- **Technical possibilities:** what methods are available? What instruments exist?

But theory and empirics also depend on method:
- Method determines what data we can obtain
- Method influences data interpretation
- Method limits theory's possibilities

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand interconnections and problems of each component.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Theoretical Level: Concepts, Models, Laws

**What is Theory?**

Theory is a system of interconnected statements that:
- **Explains** phenomena (why does this happen, not that?)
- **Predicts** phenomena (what will happen under certain conditions?)
- **Organizes** knowledge (links different facts into a unified system)

**Structure of Theory:**

1. **Concepts:** abstract representations of phenomena (for example, "memory", "motivation", "personality")
2. **Models:** simplified representations of reality (for example, Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model)
3. **Laws:** regularities, connections between phenomena (for example, Thorndike's law of effect)
4. **Principles:** basic assumptions of theory (for example, reinforcement principle in behaviorism)

**Functions of Theory:**

1. **Explanation:** theory explains why phenomena occur
2. **Prediction:** theory predicts what will happen under certain conditions
3. **Organization:** theory links different facts into a unified system
4. **Direction of Research:** theory indicates what to study, what hypotheses to test

**Problems of Theory:**

1. **Abstraction:** theories are abstract, they do not describe specific phenomena, but general patterns

2. **Incompleteness:** theories do not describe all aspects of phenomena, they simplify reality

3. **Competition:** different theories can explain the same phenomena differently

4. **Variability:** theories develop, change, are replaced by new ones

**Examples of Theories in Psychology:**

**Cognitive Dissonance Theory (Festinger):**
- **Concepts:** cognitive dissonance, consonance, dissonance
- **Model:** person strives for consonance, avoids dissonance
- **Prediction:** under dissonance, person will change beliefs or behavior
- **Explanation:** why people change opinions after making a decision

**Social Learning Theory (Bandura):**
- **Concepts:** social learning, modeling, observation
- **Model:** learning through observation and modeling
- **Prediction:** observation affects behavior
- **Explanation:** how people learn social behavior

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 3: "Theories" — on structure and functions of theories
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962, Engl. trans. 2003)
  - Chapter 3: "Normal Science" — on the role of theories in science
- **Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes"** (1970)
  - On structure of research programs and theories

### 3.2. Empirical Level: Facts, Data, Observations

**What is Empirics?**

Empirics are observations, data, facts obtained through experience (observation, experiment, measurement).

**Levels of Empirics:**

1. **Observations:** direct perception of phenomena
2. **Data:** recorded observations (numbers, records, reports)
3. **Facts:** interpreted data, accepted by community as true

**The Problem of "Pure Facts":**

**Theory-Ladenness of Observations:**

Observations are not neutral — they depend on theories:
- What we see depends on our theories
- The same data can be interpreted differently
- "Pure facts" do not exist — facts are always interpreted

**Example:** Stroop Effect:
- **Observation:** people are slower to name word color when the word denotes a different color
- **Data:** reaction time in different conditions
- **Fact:** Stroop effect exists
- **Interpretation:** depends on theory (attention? automatic processing? conflict?)

**The Problem of Induction:**

Can we derive theories from facts? Problem of induction (Hume, Popper):
- Observing specific cases does not prove a general statement
- Observing that many metals expand when heated does not prove that *all* metals expand
- Induction is logically unjustified

**The Problem of Basic Statements:**

What counts as "observation"? Problem of basic statements (Popper):
- Observations depend on theories (theory-ladenness)
- There are no absolute "basic statements"
- What counts as a fact depends on theory

**The Problem of Measurement:**

In psychology, measurement is problematic:
- Many psychological phenomena are not directly observable
- Measurement requires operationalization (definition through observable variables)
- Operationalization depends on theory

**Example:** Measuring Intelligence:
- What is intelligence? (theoretical question)
- How to measure it? (operationalization: IQ tests)
- But IQ tests measure not intelligence, but ability to solve tests
- Problem: are we measuring what we want to measure?

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 5: "The Problem of the Empirical Basis" — on basic statements
- **Willard Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"** (1951, English, Russian trans. in "Philosophy of Science", 1996)
  - Critique of analytic-synthetic distinction
  - On theory-ladenness of observations
- **Norwood Hanson, "Patterns of Discovery"** (1958, English)
  - On theory-ladenness of observations

### 3.3. Method: Bridge Between Theory and Empirics

**What is Method?**

Method is a way of obtaining data, research techniques that link theory and empirics.

**Functions of Method:**

1. **Data Collection:** method allows obtaining empirical data
2. **Operationalization:** method determines how to measure theoretical concepts
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** method allows testing theoretical predictions
4. **Interpretation:** method influences data interpretation

**Structure of Method:**

1. **Research Design:** how to organize research? (experiment, survey, observation)
2. **Procedure:** how to collect data? (instructions, conditions, measurements)
3. **Data Analysis:** how to process data? (statistics, qualitative analysis)
4. **Interpretation:** how to interpret results? (through the lens of theory)

**The Problem of Method Choice:**

Method depends on:
- **Theory:** what do we want to know? What hypotheses are we testing?
- **Empirics:** what data are available? What can be observed?
- **Technical Possibilities:** what methods are available? What instruments exist?

**Example:** Studying Memory:
- **Theory:** Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model
- **Method:** experiment, memory tests
- **Empirics:** reaction time, number of remembered words
- **Interpretation:** through the lens of theory (short-term memory, long-term memory)

**The Problem of Method:**

1. **Method Limits Theory's Possibilities:**
   - Different methods give different data
   - Method determines what we can know
   - Method influences data interpretation

2. **Method Depends on Theory:**
   - Theory determines what methods are needed
   - Theory determines how to interpret data
   - Theory determines what counts as a fact

3. **Method and Theory Are Interdependent:**
   - Cannot choose method without theory
   - Cannot verify theory without method
   - Method and theory develop together

**Literature:**
- **John Stuart Mill, "A System of Logic"** (1843, English)
  - Book VI: "On the Methods of Social Sciences"
  - On methods of obtaining data
- **Donald Campbell, "Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research"** (1963, English, Russian trans. 1980)
  - On research methods and their limitations

### 3.4. Interconnections Between Theory, Empirics, and Method

**Hermeneutic Circle in Science:**

Theory, empirics, and method are interdependent — create a "hermeneutic circle":
- **Theory** is needed to know what to observe (what counts as a fact)
- **Empirics** is needed to verify theory (data for verification)
- **Method** is needed to obtain data (research techniques)
- But method depends on theory, theory depends on empirics, empirics depends on method

**How Scientific Research Works:**

Scientific research is a cyclic process:

1. **Theory** → formulates hypotheses, predictions
2. **Method** → determines how to test hypotheses, obtain data
3. **Empirics** → obtains data, tests hypotheses
4. **Interpretation** → interprets data through the lens of theory
5. **Feedback** → results affect theory, method, new questions

**Example Cycle:** Studying False Memory Effect (Loftus):

1. **Theory:** memory is reconstructive, influenced by post-event information
2. **Hypothesis:** post-event information can change memories
3. **Method:** experiment, video showing, post-event information, memory test
4. **Empirics:** data on false memories
5. **Interpretation:** memory is reconstructive, influenced by post-event information
6. **Feedback:** theory confirmed, new questions about mechanisms

**The Problem of Priority:**

**Position 1: Empirics is Primary (Empiricism)**
- First we collect facts, then we build theories
- Problem: can we collect facts without theory? What counts as a fact?

**Position 2: Theory is Primary (Rationalism)**
- First we build theories, then we verify them with facts
- Problem: where do theories come from? How to verify them without data?

**Position 3: Method is Primary (Instrumentalism)**
- Method determines what we can know
- Problem: method depends on theory, theory depends on method

**Realistic Position:**

Theory, empirics, and method are interdependent:
- No absolute priority
- They develop together
- Scientific research is a cyclic process

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 1: on demarcation problem and interconnection of theory and empirics
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962, Engl. trans. 2003)
  - Chapter 4: "Normal Science as Puzzle-Solving" — on the role of theory in research
- **Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes"** (1970)
  - On interconnection of theory, empirics, and method in research programs

### 3.5. The Problem of Theory-Ladenness of Observations

**Main Idea:**

Observations are not neutral — they are theory-laden. What we see depends on our theories.

**Examples:**

**1. Perception:** Two people look at the same thing, but see differently:
- Behaviorist sees: stimulus → response
- Cognitivist sees: information processing, schemas, models

**2. Data Interpretation:** The same data can be interpreted differently:
- Milgram experiment (obedience):
  - **Interpretation 1:** people tend to obey authority
  - **Interpretation 2:** situational factors affect behavior
  - **Interpretation 3:** people follow social norms

**3. Measurement:** Measurement depends on theory:
- Measuring intelligence through IQ tests assumes a theory of intelligence
- Measuring personality traits through questionnaires assumes a theory of personality

**The Problem of "Pure Facts":**

"Pure facts" do not exist — facts are always interpreted:
- Fact depends on theory (what counts as a fact?)
- Fact depends on method (how to obtain a fact?)
- Fact depends on language (how to describe a fact?)

**Consequences:**

1. **No Neutral Observation:** All observations are theory-laden

2. **Data Do Not Determine Theory:** The same data can be interpreted differently

3. **Theory Influences Interpretation:** Different theories give different interpretations of the same data

4. **Problem of Objectivity:** If observations are theory-laden, is objectivity possible?

**Literature:**
- **Norwood Hanson, "Patterns of Discovery"** (1958, English)
  - Chapter 1: "Observation" — on theory-ladenness of observations
- **Willard Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"** (1951, English, Russian trans. in "Philosophy of Science", 1996)

- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 5: "The Problem of the Empirical Basis" — on basic statements

   - **Theory:** system of concepts, models, laws, explaining and predicting phenomena
   - **Empirics:** observations, data, facts obtained through experience
   - **Method:** ways of obtaining data, research techniques

2. **Interconnections of Components:**
   - Theory, empirics, and method are interdependent — create a "hermeneutic circle"
   - No absolute priority of one component
   - Scientific research is a cyclic process

3. **The Problem of Theory-Ladenness:**
   - Observations are not neutral — they are theory-laden
   - "Pure facts" do not exist — facts are always interpreted
   - The same data can be interpreted differently

4. **The Problem of Priority:**
   - Empiricism: empirics is primary, but can we collect facts without theory?
   - Rationalism: theory is primary, but where do theories come from?

5. **Realistic Position:**
   - Theory, empirics, and method develop together
   - Scientific research is a cyclic process
   - It is important to understand interconnections and limitations of each component

**Practical Conclusions:**

1. **Understanding Interconnections:** Understanding interconnections of theory, empirics, and method helps in planning and interpreting research.

2. **Critical Approach:** It is important to be aware of theory-ladenness of observations and consider this when interpreting data.

3. **Method Choice:** Method choice should be justified considering theory, empirics, and technical possibilities.

4. **Cyclic Process:** Scientific research is not a linear process from theory to empirics, but a cyclic process of mutual influence.

   - What methods are used?
   - What data are obtained?
   - How are data interpreted through the lens of theory?
   - How does method influence interpretation?

2. Analyze the problem of theory-ladenness of observations:
   - Provide examples when different theories give different interpretations of the same data
   - How does this affect research objectivity?

3. Think about interconnection of theory, empirics, and method:
   - Can research start without all three components?
   - How do they develop together?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading chapters 1 and 5 from Popper's "The Logic of Scientific Discovery" — this is a classic exposition of the problem of interconnection between theory and empirics. Then read Hanson's work "Patterns of Discovery" — it well illustrates the problem of theory-ladenness of observations.
