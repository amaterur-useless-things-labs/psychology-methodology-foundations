# Lecture 13: What Counts as Knowledge in Psychology?

## 1. Introduction

What counts as knowledge in psychology? How does knowledge differ from opinion, belief, assumption? How do we determine that something is knowledge, not just opinion?

These questions are fundamental for epistemology of psychology — theory of knowledge about how we obtain knowledge. Different approaches give different answers to these questions, which affects psychology methodology.

In this lecture, we will examine what counts as knowledge in psychology: types of knowledge (empirical, theoretical, practical), criteria of knowledge (truth, justification, intersubjectivity), and problems of psychological knowledge.

**Lecture goal:** Understand what counts as knowledge in psychology, criteria of knowledge, and problems of psychological knowledge.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Knowledge in Psychology

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, question often arises: what do we know, and what do we only assume? Different approaches give different answers:
- **Empiricism:** knowledge is data, facts
- **Rationalism:** knowledge is theories, concepts
- **Pragmatism:** knowledge is what works in practice

How to determine what is knowledge? This is a fundamental question of epistemology.

**The Problem of Defining Knowledge:**

**Classical Definition (Plato):**
- Knowledge = justified true belief
- But what does "true" mean? What does "justified" mean?

**Modern Problems:**
- Problem of truth: what does "true" psychological statement mean?
- Problem of justification: how to justify psychological knowledge?
- Problem of contextuality: does knowledge depend on context?

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, problem is especially acute:
- Many statements difficult to test (unconscious, experiences)
- Different approaches give different answers
- Knowledge depends on context (culture, history, individuality)

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand various concepts of knowledge and their limitations.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Types of Knowledge in Psychology

**1. Empirical Knowledge (Data, Facts)**

**Characteristics:**

1. **Based on Observation:** knowledge obtained through observation, experiment
   - Example: reaction time in experiment, survey results

2. **Facts:** statements about observable events
   - Example: "people name word color slower when word denotes different color" (Stroop effect)

3. **Testability:** can be tested through observation or experiment
   - Example: can repeat experiment and test fact

**Examples of Empirical Knowledge in Psychology:**

1. **Facts About Behavior:**
   - "People tend to fundamental attribution error"
   - "Short-term memory has limited capacity (7±2 items)"

2. **Facts About Processes:**
   - "Information processing requires time"
   - "Attention has limited capacity"

**Problems of Empirical Knowledge:**

1. **Theoretical Loading:** facts are theoretically loaded
   - Example: what we consider fact depends on theory

2. **Contextuality:** facts depend on context
   - Example: facts may not apply to other contexts

3. **Interpretation:** facts require interpretation
   - Example: same data can be interpreted differently

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Russian trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 5: "Problem of Empirical Basis" — on empirical knowledge

**2. Theoretical Knowledge (Concepts, Laws, Models)**

**Characteristics:**

1. **Abstract:** knowledge about general patterns, not specific cases
   - Example: cognitive dissonance theory, memory model

2. **Explains:** explains events through concepts, laws, models
   - Example: explains why people change opinions after making decision

3. **Predicts:** predicts new facts
   - Example: predicts behavior in new situations

**Examples of Theoretical Knowledge in Psychology:**

1. **Theories:**
   - Cognitive Dissonance Theory (Festinger)
   - Social Learning Theory (Bandura)

2. **Models:**
   - Atkinson-Shiffrin Memory Model
   - Information Processing Model

3. **Laws:**
   - Law of Effect (Thorndike)
   - Forgetting Law (Ebbinghaus)

**Problems of Theoretical Knowledge:**

1. **Problem of Testing:** difficult to test abstract theories
   - Example: how to test unconscious theory?

2. **Theory Competition:** different theories can explain same events
   - Example: cognitive and behaviorist interpretations

3. **Variability:** theories develop, change
   - Example: memory theories changed over time

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Russian trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 3: "Theories" — on theoretical knowledge

**3. Practical Knowledge (Skills, Experience, Intuition)**

**Characteristics:**

1. **Based on Experience:** knowledge obtained through practice
   - Example: therapy skills, clinician intuition

2. **Ability:** knowledge "how", not "what"
   - Example: how to conduct therapy, how to interpret behavior

3. **Contextual:** knowledge depends on context, situation
   - Example: different approaches in different situations

**Examples of Practical Knowledge in Psychology:**

1. **Clinical Knowledge:**
   - Therapy skills, intuition, experience working with clients
   - Example: ability to understand client, choose approach

2. **Organizational Knowledge:**
   - Knowledge about how to work in organization
   - Example: understanding group dynamics

3. **Intuition:**
   - Intuitive understanding of behavior
   - Example: "feeling" of what is happening with client

**Problems of Practical Knowledge:**

1. **Difficult to Transfer:** practical knowledge difficult to transfer formally
   - Example: how to teach intuition?

2. **Subjectivity:** practical knowledge is subjective
   - Example: different experience can give different knowledge

3. **Testability:** difficult to test practical knowledge
   - Example: how to test that intuition is correct?

**Literature:**
- **Michael Polanyi, "Personal Knowledge"** (1958, English, Russian trans. 1985)
  - On practical, tacit knowledge

### 3.2. Criteria of Knowledge

**Classical Definition of Knowledge (Plato):**

Knowledge = Justified True Belief (JTB)

**Components:**

1. **Belief:** conviction that statement is true
2. **Truth:** statement corresponds to reality
3. **Justification:** there are justifications for belief

**Gettier Problem:**

Gettier showed that JTB is insufficient for knowledge:
- Can have justified true belief, but not know
- Example: belief that X, with justification, X is true, but belief based on false premises

**Modern Criteria of Knowledge:**

**1. Truth:**

**Theories of Truth:**

- **Correspondent:** truth = correspondence to reality
  - Example: statement is true if corresponds to facts
  - Problem: what does "corresponds" mean? How to test correspondence?

- **Coherent:** truth = consistency with other statements
  - Example: statement is true if consistent with theory
  - Problem: consistency does not mean truth

- **Pragmatic:** truth = what works in practice
  - Example: statement is true if works in practice
  - Problem: what works now, may not work later

**Problem of Truth in Psychology:**

What does "true" psychological statement mean?
- Corresponds to reality? But what reality?
- Consistent with theory? But which theories?
- Works in practice? But in what context?

**2. Justification:**

**Types of Justification:**

- **Empirical:** justification through data, facts
  - Example: justification through experiment

- **Theoretical:** justification through theory, logic
  - Example: justification through logical conclusions

- **Pragmatic:** justification through practice
  - Example: justification through practical effectiveness

**Problem of Justification in Psychology:**

How to justify psychological knowledge?
- Empirically? But data are theoretically loaded
- Theoretically? But theories compete
- Pragmatically? But what works in one context, may not work in another

**3. Intersubjectivity (Community Agreement):**

**Idea:**

Knowledge is what scientific community agrees on:
- Not personal opinion, but public agreement
- Example: scientific community agrees that Stroop effect exists

**Problem of Intersubjectivity:**

- Agreement does not mean truth
  - Example: community can be wrong (historical examples)
- Problem of agreement: how to achieve agreement?
  - Example: different approaches give different answers

**Literature:**
- **Edmund Gettier, "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?"** (1963, English, Russian trans. in "Philosophy of Science", 1996)
  - Classic work on problem of defining knowledge
- **Alvin Goldman, "A Causal Theory of Knowing"** (1967, English)
  - On causality as basis of knowledge

### 3.3. Problems of Psychological Knowledge

**1. Problem of Truth**

What does "true" psychological statement mean?

**Problems:**

- **Multiple Realities:** different approaches see different realities
  - Example: behaviorism sees behavior, cognitivism — processes

- **Contextuality:** truth depends on context
  - Example: statement may be true in one context, false in another

- **Variability:** truth may change over time
  - Example: what was considered true, may become false

**Examples:**

1. **Statement About Unconscious:**
   - True? False? How to test?
   - Different approaches give different answers

2. **Statement About Memory:**
   - "Memory is reconstructive" — true?
   - Depends on context, theory

**2. Contextuality of Knowledge**

Psychological knowledge depends on context:
- **Cultural Context:** knowledge depends on culture
  - Example: behavior understood differently in different cultures

- **Historical Context:** knowledge depends on time
  - Example: what was considered knowledge, may change

- **Individual Context:** knowledge depends on individual
  - Example: individual differences in behavior

**Problem:**

Can knowledge be generalized to other contexts?
- If knowledge is contextual, how to generalize?
- What is common between contexts?

**3. Knowledge About Singular vs. General**

**Problem:**

Psychology studies both singular and general:
- **Singular:** specific cases, individuals
  - Example: studying specific client

- **General:** patterns, general principles
  - Example: laws of behavior

How to combine knowledge about singular and general?

**Problem of Generalization:**

How to generalize from singular to general?
- Problem of induction: particular cases do not prove general
- Example: studying several cases does not prove general pattern

**Problem of Application:**

How to apply general to singular?
- General laws do not describe specific cases
- Example: general behavior law does not describe specific individual

**Literature:**
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962, Russian trans. 2003)
  - On contextuality of knowledge
- **Paul Feyerabend, "Against Method"** (1975, Russian trans. 2007)
  - On multiplicity of knowledge

### Practical Assignments

1. Analyze a specific psychological statement:
   - Is this knowledge or opinion?
   - What type of knowledge? (empirical, theoretical, practical)
   - What knowledge criteria are applied?

2. Evaluate knowledge by JTB criteria:
   - Belief: conviction in statement
   - Truth: does it correspond to reality?
   - Justification: are there justifications?

3. Analyze problem of contextuality:
   - Does knowledge depend on context?
   - How to generalize knowledge?
   - Can general knowledge exist?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Gettier's work "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" — this is a classic work on problem of defining knowledge. Then study various theories of truth (Russell — correspondent, Quine — coherent, James — pragmatic) — they show different approaches to truth.
