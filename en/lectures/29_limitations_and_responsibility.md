# Lecture 29: Limitations and Responsibility of Psychology

## 1. Introduction

Psychology has limitations — ethical, methodological, theoretical, practical. And with these limitations comes responsibility — to participants, society, profession, science.

In this lecture, we will examine limitations and responsibility of psychology: limitations (ethical, methodological, theoretical, practical), responsibility (to participants, society, profession, science), and problematic areas (application of knowledge, psychology and power).

**Lecture goal:** Understand limitations of psychology, responsibility of psychologists, and problematic areas of application of psychological knowledge.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Limitations: Ethical, Methodological, Theoretical, Practical

**1. Ethical Limitations**

**What is This?**

Ethical limitations — limitations related to protection of people:
- **Cannot Study Everything:** some studies are unethical
- **Protection of Participants:** need to protect well-being of participants
- **Informed Consent:** participants must understand what they agree to
- **Confidentiality:** need to protect confidentiality of participants

**Examples:**

1. **Impossibility of Harmful Studies:**
   - Cannot intentionally cause harm
   - Cannot violate well-being
   - Example: cannot intentionally induce depression

2. **Limitations in Methods:**
   - Some methods are unethical
   - Need to choose ethical methods
   - Example: deception may be unethical

3. **Protection of Vulnerable Groups:**
   - Special limitations for vulnerable groups
   - Children, people with disabilities
   - Example: additional protections for children

**Problem:**

Ethical limitations limit research:
- Some important questions cannot be studied
- Need to find ethical ways
- How to balance knowledge and ethics?

**Literature:**
- **Milgram Experiment:** showed importance of ethical limitations
- **Stanford Prison Experiment:** showed problems of ethics

**2. Methodological Limitations**

**What is This?**

Methodological limitations — limitations of research methods:
- **Limitations of Experiments:** laboratory environment, control of variables
- **Limitations of Observation:** observer effect, representativeness
- **Limitations of Self-Reports:** inaccuracy, distortions
- **Limitations of Generalizability:** specificity of context

**Examples:**

1. **Laboratory Environment:**
   - Artificial environment
   - Limited ecological validity
   - Example: behavior in laboratory differs from real

2. **Observer Effect:**
   - Behavior changes under observation
   - Problem of reactivity
   - Example: Hawthorne effect

3. **Problem of Generalizability:**
   - Results specific to context
   - Difficult to generalize
   - Example: cultural specificity

**Problem:**

Methodological limitations limit conclusions:
- Results limited by methods
- Need to recognize limitations
- How to improve methods?

**Literature:**
- **Donald Campbell, Julian Stanley, "Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research"** (1963, English)

   - Application may have unexpected consequences
   - Difficult to predict
   - Example: application of psychological knowledge in marketing

3. **Limitations of Generalization:**
   - Difficult to generalize to different groups
   - Need caution
   - Example: applying results on psychology students to general population

**Problem:**

Practical limitations limit application:
- Application limited

### Practical Assignments

1. Study ethics code of psychologists:

   - How are they applied in practice?

2. Analyze problematic application of psychology:
   - What ethical problems?
   - How can be improved?
   - What guidelines needed?

3. Develop ethical guidelines for application:
   - What principles?
   - What procedures?
   - How to ensure compliance?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading ethics codes of psychologists — they show principles of responsibility. Then study works on problems of application (Lilienfeld) and psychology and power (Foucault). Consider specific problematic cases — this will help understand limitations and responsibility in practice.
