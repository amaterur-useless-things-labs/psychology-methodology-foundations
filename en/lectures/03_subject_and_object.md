# Lecture 3: Subject and Object of Psychology: Why It Has Problems

## 1. Introduction

One of the fundamental questions of psychology methodology is the question of the **subject** and **object** of psychology. What is the difference between subject and object? Why is this distinction critical in psychology? What exactly does psychology study: behavior, mind, consciousness, humans?

These questions may seem abstract, but they have important methodological consequences. Different answers to these questions lead to different research methods, different validity criteria, different theories.

In this lecture, we will examine the difference between subject and object of research, the specificity of psychology's object (humans), and the problems this creates for psychology methodology.

**Lecture goal:** Understand the difference between subject and object of psychology, become aware of the specificity of psychology's object and the problems this creates for research.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Defining the Object and Subject of Psychology

**Why is this important?**

In natural sciences, the object of study is usually clear:
- Physics studies physical objects and their properties
- Biology studies living organisms
- Chemistry studies substances and their transformations

But what does psychology study? The answer is not so obvious:
- Behavior? But it is studied by both biology and sociology
- Mind? But what is that? Unobservable
- Consciousness? But how to study it?
- Humans? But they are studied by many sciences

**The Problem of Multiple Definitions:**

In psychology, there is no unified definition of the object of study. Different approaches define the object differently:
- Behaviorism: behavior
- Cognitivism: mental processes
- Psychoanalysis: unconscious
- Cultural-historical approach: activity

Are these simply different perspectives or different objects? Or one object, but different subjects?

**The Problem of Object Specificity:**

Humans are a unique object of study:
- **Activity:** humans actively react to research (Hawthorne effect, experimenter effect)
- **Reflexivity:** humans are aware that they are being studied, and this affects behavior
- **Variability:** humans change over time, in different contexts
- **Subjectivity:** inner experience is not directly observable
- **Ethical limitations:** cannot experiment with humans as objects of nature

These characteristics create methodological problems that do not exist in natural sciences.

**The Problem of Introspection:**

Psychology historically began with introspection — self-observation. But introspection is problematic:
- Not observable by others (problem of objectivity)
- Depends on language and culture
- May be inaccurate or distorted
- Changes during observation (reflexivity)

Can we build a science on introspection? Or should psychology study only observable behavior?

**The Problem of Research Subject:**

Even if the object is humans, what exactly about them is studied?
- Psychological processes? But they are unobservable
- Behavior? But it depends on many factors
- Activity? But what is that?
- Experiences? But how to study them objectively?

Different approaches choose different research subjects, which leads to different methods and theories.

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different answers lead to different methodological approaches. It is important to understand the foundations of various positions.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Object vs. Subject of Research

**Main Difference:**

- **Object of research** — what is studied (for example, humans, groups, phenomena)
- **Subject of research** — aspect of the object under which it is studied, perspective, way of studying

**Examples from Other Sciences:**

**Biology:**
- Object: living organisms
- Subject: structure, functions, development, evolution

**Sociology:**
- Object: society, social groups
- Subject: social relations, norms, institutions

**Psychology:**
- Object: humans (or groups of people)
- Subject: mind, behavior, consciousness, activity (depending on approach)

**Importance of the Difference:**

One object can have different subjects. For example, humans are studied by:
- Biology: from the perspective of organism and its functions
- Psychology: from the perspective of mind and behavior
- Sociology: from the perspective of social roles and interactions
- Philosophy: from the perspective of consciousness and being

**Literature:**
- **Alexei Leontiev, "Activity, Consciousness, Personality"** (1975, Russian)
  - Chapter 1: on the subject of psychology
  - Chapter 2: on the object of psychology as activity
- **Sergei Rubinstein, "Fundamentals of General Psychology"** (1946, Russian)
  - Chapter 1: subject of psychology and its specificity
  - Chapter 2: methods of psychology

### 3.2. Specificity of Psychology's Object

**Human as Object of Research:**

Humans are a unique object that creates specific methodological problems:

**1. Activity:**

Humans are not passive objects, but active subjects. They:
- React to research
- May change behavior knowing they are being studied (Hawthorne effect)
- May influence research results
- May manipulate the researcher

**Hawthorne Effect:**
Classic example — research at the Hawthorne plant (1924-1932). Workers increased productivity when they knew they were being studied, regardless of changes in working conditions. This showed that knowledge of research itself affects behavior.

**Experimenter Effect:**
Experimenters may inadvertently influence results through expectations, nonverbal signals, data interpretation. This is a problem of researcher subjectivity.

**Problem:** How to control object activity? Can we study "natural" behavior if it changes during research?

**2. Reflexivity:**

Humans are aware that they are being studied, and this affects:
- Behavior (Hawthorne effect, social desirability)
- Statements (self-censorship, embellishment)
- Experiences (reflection may change experiences)

**Problem of Reflexivity:**
Research in psychology changes the object of research itself. This creates a "reflexive circle": psychology studies humans, but knowledge of psychology changes humans, which changes the subject of study.

**Example:** When people learn about psychological effects (for example, cognitive biases), they may change their behavior, which affects research results.

**Problem:** Can we build an objective science about a subject who is aware of research and reacts to it?

**3. Variability:**

Humans change:
- Over time (development, learning, fatigue)
- In different contexts (home, work, laboratory)
- In different cultures
- Depending on situation

**Problem of Generalization:**

Can we generalize research results to:
- Other people?
- Other situations?
- Other times?
- Other cultures?

This is the problem of **ecological validity** — applicability of laboratory research results to real life.

**4. Subjectivity:**

Inner experience (thoughts, feelings, experiences) is not directly observable by others. How to study it?

**Problem of Access to Subjectivity:**

- **Introspection:** self-observation, but it is subjective and unobservable by others
- **Self-reports:** surveys, interviews, but they depend on language and culture
- **Physiological correlates:** brain activity, but this is not the experience itself
- **Behavior:** external manifestations, but this is not inner experience

**Problem:** Can we objectively study the subjective? Or should psychology study only the observable?

**5. Ethical Limitations:**

Humans cannot be studied as objects of nature:
- Cannot experiment without informed consent
- Cannot cause harm
- Cannot violate confidentiality
- Cannot manipulate without ethical justification

**Problem:** Ethical limitations restrict research possibilities. Some important questions cannot be studied experimentally.

**Literature:**
- **Robert Rosenthal, "Experimenter Effects in Behavioral Research"** (1966, English)
  - On the problem of experimenter influence on results
- **Robert Orne, "On the Social Psychology of the Psychological Experiment: With Particular Reference to Demand Characteristics and Their Implications"** (1962, English)
  - On how participants react to experimenter expectations
- **William James, "The Principles of Psychology"** (1890, English)
  - Chapter 7: on the stream of consciousness and subjective experience
- **Edmund Husserl, "Ideas for a Pure Phenomenology"** (1913, Russian trans. 1999)
  - Chapter 1: on subjective experience and its study

### 3.3. The Problem of Introspection

**Historical Context:**

Psychology historically began with introspection (Wundt, Titchener, structural psychology school). But introspection proved problematic:

**Problems of Introspection:**

1. **Unobservability by Others:** Others cannot verify introspection results — this is a problem of objectivity.

2. **Dependence on Language:** Introspective reports depend on language and culture. Different languages describe experiences differently.

3. **Inaccuracy:** People may inaccurately describe their experiences, confuse cause and effect, embellish.

4. **Reflexivity:** The process of introspection may change the experience itself. Observing an experience changes it.

5. **Retrospective Error:** Introspection is often retrospective — past experience is described, which may be distorted by memory.

**Critique of Introspection:**

**Behaviorism (Watson, Skinner):** Rejected introspection as unscientific. Psychology should study only observable behavior. Consciousness is a "black box" that cannot be studied.

**Problem:** Behaviorism ignores internal processes that may be important for understanding behavior.

**Modern Approaches to Subjectivity:**

1. **Qualitative Methods:** Interviews, phenomenological analysis — attempt to understand subjective experience through language and interpretation.

2. **Physiological Correlates:** Neuroimaging, electrophysiology — studying the subjective through objective correlates.

3. **Neurophenomenology (Varela):** Attempt to combine first and third person — subjective experience + objective data.

**Literature:**
- **Edward Titchener, "A Textbook of Psychology"** (1909-1910, English)
  - On the method of introspection in structural psychology
- **John Watson, "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It"** (1913, English, Russian trans. in "Anthology on History of Psychology", 1980)
  - Critique of introspection and behaviorist manifesto
- **Francisco Varela, "Neurophenomenology"** (1996, English)
  - On the attempt to combine subjective experience and objective data
- **William James, "The Principles of Psychology"** (1890, English)
  - Chapter 7: on the stream of consciousness and the problem of introspection

### 3.4. Different Definitions of Psychology's Subject

**Different Approaches Define Psychology's Subject Differently:**

**1. Behaviorism: Behavior**

- **Object:** humans, animals
- **Subject:** behavior — observable reactions to stimuli
- **Method:** experiment, observation, variable control
- **Problem:** ignores internal processes, consciousness

**2. Cognitivism: Mental Processes**

- **Object:** humans (and other information systems)
- **Subject:** mental processes — information processing
- **Method:** experiment, modeling, computer simulations
- **Problem:** simplification, problem of consciousness

**3. Psychoanalysis: Unconscious**

- **Object:** humans
- **Subject:** unconscious processes, motives, conflicts
- **Method:** interpretation, transference analysis, clinical observation
- **Problem:** difficult to verify, subjectivity of interpretations

**4. Cultural-Historical Approach (Vygotsky, Leontiev): Activity**

- **Object:** humans in society
- **Subject:** activity — mediated by cultural tools
- **Method:** observation, experiment, activity analysis
- **Problem:** difficulty of operationalization, limited empirics

**5. Phenomenological Approach: Experiences**

- **Object:** humans
- **Subject:** experiences, phenomena of consciousness
- **Method:** introspection, phenomenological analysis, interviews
- **Problem:** subjectivity, unobservability by others

**Question:** Are these different subjects of one object or different objects? Or one object studied from different positions?

**Literature:**
- **Lev Vygotsky, "History of the Development of Higher Mental Functions"** (1931, Russian)
  - On the subject of psychology as activity
- **Alexei Leontiev, "Activity, Consciousness, Personality"** (1975, Russian)
  - Chapter 1: on the subject of psychology as activity
- **Ulric Neisser, "Cognitive Psychology"** (1967, English, Russian trans. 1981)
  - Chapter 1: on the subject of cognitive psychology as information processing

### 3.5. The Problem of Demarcation with Other Sciences

**Where Does Psychology End and Biology Begin?**

Psychology studies behavior and mind, biology — organism and its functions. Where is the boundary?

**Examples of Overlaps:**
- Neuropsychology: psychology or biology?
- Psychophysiology: psychology or biology?
- Evolutionary psychology: psychology or biology?

**Where Does Psychology End and Sociology Begin?**

Psychology studies individuals, sociology — society. Where is the boundary?

**Examples of Overlaps:**
- Social psychology: psychology or sociology?
- Sociology of personality: psychology or sociology?

**Where Does Psychology End and Philosophy Begin?**

Psychology studies mind empirically, philosophy — conceptually. Where is the boundary?

**Examples of Overlaps:**
- Philosophy of mind: psychology or philosophy?
- Philosophy of science: where is psychology?

**Problem:** Boundaries between disciplines are blurred. Psychology is at the intersection of natural, social, and human sciences.

**Literature:**
- **Jerry Fodor, "The Modularity of Mind"** (1983, English, Russian trans. 2004)
  - On boundaries between psychology and other sciences
- **David Marr, "Vision"** (1982, English, Russian trans. 1987)
  - On three levels of explanation (computational, algorithmic, physical)

## 4. Conclusions

**Key Ideas of the Lecture:**

1. **Difference Between Object and Subject:**
   - Object — what is studied (humans)
   - Subject — aspect of the object under which it is studied (mind, behavior, activity)

2. **Specificity of Psychology's Object:**
   - Humans are a unique object: active, reflexive, variable, subjective
   - This creates methodological problems that do not exist in natural sciences

3. **Problems of Studying Humans:**
   - Activity: humans react to research (Hawthorne effect, experimenter effect)
   - Reflexivity: knowledge of research affects behavior
   - Variability: problem of generalizing results
   - Subjectivity: problem of access to inner experience
   - Ethical limitations: cannot experiment as with objects of nature

4. **The Problem of Introspection:**
   - Introspection was historically the main method
   - But it is problematic: unobservable by others, subjective, may change experiences
   - Different approaches solve the problem of subjectivity differently

5. **Different Definitions of Subject:**
   - Different approaches define subject differently: behavior, mind, activity, experiences
   - This leads to different methods and theories
   - Question: are these different subjects or different perspectives on one object?

**Practical Conclusions:**

1. **Understanding Limitations:** Understanding object specificity helps become aware of limitations of psychological research.

2. **Method Choice:** Different subject definitions require different methods. It is important to justify method choice.

3. **Result Evaluation:** Need to consider object specificity when evaluating results: can we generalize? How ecologically valid are the results?

4. **Methodological Pluralism:** Different approaches may be different perspectives on one object, not different objects.

## 5. Problems

**Open Questions:**

1. **What Exactly Does Psychology Study?**
   - Behavior? Mind? Consciousness? Activity?
   - Are these different subjects or different perspectives?

2. **Can We Objectively Study the Subjective?**
   - Introspection is problematic, but it is difficult to abandon subjective experience
   - Through objective correlates?
   - Or is subjectivity fundamentally non-scientific?

3. **How to Control Object Activity?**
   - Humans react to research
   - Can we study "natural" behavior?
   - How to minimize research influence on results?

4. **Where Are Psychology's Boundaries?**
   - Where does psychology end and biology/sociology/philosophy begin?
   - Is this a problem or a feature of psychology?

5. **The Problem of Generalization:**
   - Can we generalize research results?
   - To whom/what can we generalize?
   - Problem of ecological validity

**Practical Problems:**

1. **Hawthorne Effect:** How to study natural behavior if research itself affects behavior?

2. **Experimenter Effect:** How to minimize researcher influence on results?

3. **Social Desirability:** How to get honest answers if people want to look better?

4. **Ecological Validity:** How applicable are laboratory research results to real life?

5. **Ethical Limitations:** Some important questions cannot be studied experimentally. How then to study them?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand the foundations of various solutions and their limitations.
