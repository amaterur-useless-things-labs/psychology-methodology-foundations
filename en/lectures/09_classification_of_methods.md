# Lecture 9: Classification of Methods: Quantitative, Qualitative, Mixed

## 1. Introduction

Psychology uses diverse research methods: from strict experiments to deep interviews, from quantitative measurements to qualitative analysis. How to classify these methods? Which methods to use when?

In this lecture, we will examine the main classification of methods in psychology: **quantitative**, **qualitative**, and **mixed** methods. We will analyze their characteristics, pros and limitations, and when to use which type of methods.

**Lecture goal:** Understand differences between quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods, their characteristics and when to use which type.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Method Classification

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, many research methods are used:
- Experiments, surveys, tests (quantitative)
- Interviews, observations, text analysis (qualitative)
- Method combinations (mixed)

How to classify these methods? By what criteria? This is important for understanding psychology methodology.

**The Problem of Differences:**

**Quantitative Methods:**
- Focus on numerical data, statistics
- Pros: objectivity, generalizability, reproducibility
- Cons: simplification, loss of context

**Qualitative Methods:**
- Focus on meanings, experiences, context
- Pros: depth, context, discovery of new phenomena
- Cons: subjectivity, difficulty of generalization

**Mixed Methods:**
- Combination of quantitative and qualitative methods
- Pros: completeness of understanding, result validation
- Cons: complexity, requirement of expertise in different methods

**The Problem of Choice:**

Which method to use when?
- Quantitative: when numerical data, comparisons are needed
- Qualitative: when meanings, context need to be understood
- Mixed: when both are needed

But how to determine what is needed? This depends on the research question.

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, conflict often arises between quantitative and qualitative approaches:
- Quantitative methods are considered more "scientific"
- Qualitative methods are considered more "humanistic"
- How to combine them?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand differences and limitations of each type of methods.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Quantitative Methods: Experiment, Survey, Psychometrics

**What are Quantitative Methods?**

Quantitative methods are methods that use numerical data, statistical analysis to study events. Focus on measurement, counting, generalization.

**Characteristics of Quantitative Methods:**

1. **Numerical Data:** data are presented in numerical form
   - Example: reaction time in ms, number of correct answers, scale scores

2. **Statistical Analysis:** use of statistics for data analysis
   - Example: means, correlations, significance tests

3. **Measurement:** operating with variables that can be measured
   - Example: measuring intelligence, personality, behavior

4. **Generalization:** generalizing results to population
   - Example: results applicable to other people, situations

**Types of Quantitative Methods:**

1. **Experiment:**
   - Controlled research, variable manipulation
   - Types: laboratory, field, quasi-experiment
   - Example: studying influence of reinforcement on behavior

2. **Correlational Studies:**
   - Studying connections between variables without manipulation
   - Types: cross-sectional, longitudinal
   - Example: studying connection between intelligence and success

3. **Surveys, Questionnaires:**
   - Data collection through questions, questionnaires
   - Types: structured, semi-structured
   - Example: studying opinions, attitudes, behavior

4. **Psychometrics (Tests, Measurements):**
   - Measuring psychological constructs
   - Types: intelligence tests, personality tests, ability tests
   - Example: measuring IQ, personality traits

**Pros of Quantitative Methods:**

1. **Objectivity:** numerical data seem objective
   - Example: reaction time is objectively measured

2. **Generalizability:** results can be generalized to population
   - Example: results applicable to other people

3. **Reproducibility:** research can be reproduced
   - Example: other researchers can repeat experiment

4. **Statistical Testing:** hypotheses can be statistically tested
   - Example: testing statistical significance of results

**Limitations of Quantitative Methods:**

1. **Simplification:** simplify complexity of events
   - Example: measuring intelligence through IQ simplifies complexity of intelligence

2. **Loss of Context:** lose context, individual characteristics
   - Example: mean values do not reflect individual differences

3. **Problem of Operationalization:** measurement depends on operationalization
   - Example: are we measuring what we want to measure?

4. **Limitation of Measurements:** not everything can be measured quantitatively
   - Example: experiences, meanings are difficult to measure

**Literature:**
- **Donald Campbell, Julian Stanley, "Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs"** (1963, English, Russian trans. 1980)
  - On quantitative methods in psychology
- **Andy Field, "Discovering Statistics Using SPSS"** (2018, English, Russian trans. 2020)
  - On statistical analysis of quantitative data

### 3.2. Qualitative Methods: Interview, Observation, Text Analysis

**What are Qualitative Methods?**

Qualitative methods are methods that use textual data, interpretation to study events. Focus on understanding, meanings, context.

**Characteristics of Qualitative Methods:**

1. **Textual Data:** data are presented in textual form
   - Example: interviews, observations, documents

2. **Interpretation:** interpretation of data, searching for meanings
   - Example: thematic analysis, phenomenological analysis

3. **Context:** considering context, individual characteristics
   - Example: studying experiences in context

4. **Depth:** deep understanding of events
   - Example: understanding meanings, experiences

**Types of Qualitative Methods:**

1. **Interview:**
   - Conversation with participants, collecting data about experiences, opinions
   - Types: structured, semi-structured, unstructured
   - Example: studying experiences of people with depression

2. **Observation:**
   - Studying behavior in natural conditions
   - Types: participant, non-participant, structured, unstructured
   - Example: studying children's behavior at school

3. **Document Analysis, Narrative Analysis:**
   - Analysis of texts, documents, stories
   - Types: content analysis, narrative analysis, discourse analysis
   - Example: analysis of diaries, letters, interviews

4. **Phenomenological Analysis:**
   - Studying experiences, phenomena of consciousness
   - Types: phenomenological analysis, interpretative phenomenological analysis
   - Example: studying experience of fear

**Pros of Qualitative Methods:**

1. **Depth:** deep understanding of events
   - Example: understanding people's experiences

2. **Context:** considering context, individual characteristics
   - Example: studying events in their context

3. **Discovery of New Phenomena:** can discover unexpected phenomena
   - Example: discovering new forms of behavior

4. **Richness of Data:** rich, detailed data
   - Example: detailed description of experiences

**Limitations of Qualitative Methods:**

1. **Subjectivity:** interpretation may be subjective
   - Example: different researchers may interpret differently

2. **Difficulty of Generalization:** difficult to generalize results
   - Example: results may be specific to participants

3. **Difficulty of Testing:** difficult to test interpretations
   - Example: how to test correctness of interpretation?

4. **Time-Consuming:** require much time for data collection and analysis
   - Example: interviews and analysis take much time

  - On qualitative methods

### 3.3. Mixed Methods: Integration of Approaches

**What are Mixed Methods?**

Mixed methods are combination of quantitative and qualitative methods in one research. Idea: different methods give different perspectives, their integration gives complete understanding.

**Characteristics of Mixed Methods:**

1. **Integration:** combination of quantitative and qualitative methods
   - Example: survey + interview

2. **Triangulation:** validation of results through different methods
   - Example: quantitative results confirmed by qualitative data

3. **Completeness:** complete understanding of event from different sides
   - Example: quantitative data show "what", qualitative — "why"

**Types of Mixed Methods:**

1. **Sequential:**
   - First one method, then another
   - Types: exploratory (qualitative → quantitative), explanatory (quantitative → qualitative)
   - Example: first interview for understanding, then survey for testing

2. **Convergent:**
   - Both methods used simultaneously
   - Types: parallel use of methods
   - Example: survey and interview simultaneously

3. **Explanatory:**
   - Quantitative results explained by qualitative data
   - Types: quantitative data → qualitative explanation
   - Example: survey shows effect, interview explains it

**Pros of Mixed Methods:**

1. **Completeness:** complete understanding of event from different sides
   - Example: quantitative data show "what", qualitative — "why"

2. **Validation:** validation of results through different methods (triangulation)
   - Example: quantitative results confirmed by qualitative data

3. **Complementarity:** methods complement each other
   - Example: quantitative data show general trends, qualitative — individual experiences

**Limitations of Mixed Methods:**

1. **Complexity:** require expertise in different methods
   - Example: need skills in both quantitative and qualitative analysis

2. **Time-Consuming:** require more time and resources
   - Example: need to collect and analyze different types of data

3. **Integration:** difficult to integrate different types of data
   - Example: how to integrate numerical and textual data?

4. **Paradigm Conflict:** quantitative and qualitative methods based on different paradigms
   - Example: positivism vs. constructivism

   - Why was this type chosen?
   - What are limitations of this type?

2. Compare quantitative and qualitative methods:
   - What are their differences?
   - When is which method appropriate?
   - Can they be integrated?

3. Develop a research plan with mixed methods:
   - What quantitative methods to use?
   - What qualitative methods to use?
   - How to integrate results?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Creswell's work "Research Design" — it well describes all three types of methods and their differences. Then study examples of each type of methods in psychological research.
