# Lecture 15: Theoretical Integration in Psychology: Is It Possible?

## 1. Introduction

In psychology, there are many theories, approaches, paradigms: behaviorism, cognitivism, psychoanalysis, cultural-historical approach, and others. Can they be integrated into a unified theory? Is a unified theory needed in psychology?

In this lecture, we will examine the problem of theoretical integration in psychology: problems of integration (different ontologies, epistemologies, methods), attempts at integration (biopsychosocial model, integrative psychotherapy), and questions about possibility and necessity of integration.

**Lecture goal:** Understand problems of theoretical integration in psychology, various approaches to integration, and whether it is possible to integrate incompatible paradigms.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Theoretical Integration

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, there are many competing theories and approaches:
- Behaviorism, cognitivism, psychoanalysis, cultural-historical approach
- Different ontologies (what is real?), epistemologies (how to know?), methods

Can they be integrated? Is a unified theory needed?

**The Problem of Multiplicity:**

**Position 1: Integration is Necessary**
- Multiplicity means absence of unified theory
- Need unified theory for progress
- Example: physics has unified theory (theory of relativity, quantum mechanics)

**Position 2: Integration is Impossible**
- Different approaches are incompatible
- Cannot integrate incompatible paradigms
- Example: positivism and constructivism are incompatible

**Position 3: Integration is Not Needed**
- Multiplicity is normal state of science
- Different approaches study different aspects
- Example: can have different theories for different levels

**The Problem of Incompatibility:**

Different approaches have different:
- **Ontologies:** what is real? (behavior, psyche, consciousness?)
- **Epistemologies:** how to know? (experiment, interpretation, introspection?)
- **Methods:** what methods to use?

Can incompatible approaches be integrated?

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many competing approaches
- No single dominant paradigm
- Different approaches give different answers to same questions

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand problems of integration and various approaches to it.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Problems of Integration

**1. Different Ontologies (What is Real?)**

**Problem:**

Different approaches have different ontologies — representations of what is real:

**Behaviorism:**
- **Ontology:** behavior is real, psyche is black box
- **Reality:** observable behavior

**Cognitivism:**
- **Ontology:** mental processes are real
- **Reality:** cognitive processes, structures

**Psychoanalysis:**
- **Ontology:** unconscious is real
- **Reality:** unconscious processes, conflicts

**Cultural-Historical Approach:**
- **Ontology:** activity is real, psyche is product of activity
- **Reality:** activity, cultural tools

**Problem:** How to integrate different representations of reality?

**Example:** What is personality?
- **Behaviorism:** set of behavioral patterns
- **Cognitivism:** system of cognitive schemas
- **Psychoanalysis:** structure of unconscious
- **Cultural-Historical Approach:** product of activity

Different ontologies give different answers. How to integrate them?

**2. Different Epistemologies (How to Know?)**

**Problem:**

Different approaches have different epistemologies — representations of how to know:

**Positivism (Behaviorism):**
- **Epistemology:** know through observation, experiment
- **Method:** objective measurement, statistics
- **Ideal:** objectivity, reproducibility

**Constructivism (Qualitative Methods):**
- **Epistemology:** know through interpretation, understanding
- **Method:** interview, observation, text analysis
- **Ideal:** understanding, contextuality

**Hermeneutics (Psychoanalysis):**
- **Epistemology:** know through interpretation of unconscious
- **Method:** interpretation of symptoms, dreams, free associations
- **Ideal:** understanding meanings

**Problem:** How to integrate different ways of knowing?

**Example:** How to Study Depression?
- **Positivism:** measurement of symptoms, statistical analysis
- **Constructivism:** interview, understanding experiences
- **Hermeneutics:** interpretation of unconscious conflicts

Different epistemologies require different methods. How to integrate them?

**3. Different Methods**

**Problem:**

Different approaches use different methods:

**Behaviorism:**
- **Methods:** experiment, observation, measurement of behavior
- **Ideal:** objectivity, variable control

**Cognitivism:**
- **Methods:** experiment, modeling, neuroimaging
- **Ideal:** understanding processes

**Psychoanalysis:**
- **Methods:** interpretation, analysis of transference, free associations
- **Ideal:** understanding unconscious

**Cultural-Historical Approach:**
- **Methods:** observation of development, analysis of activity
- **Ideal:** understanding in context

**Problem:** How to integrate different methods?

**Example:** How to Study Memory?
- **Behaviorism:** measurement of behavior, experiments
- **Cognitivism:** modeling of processes, neuroimaging
- **Psychoanalysis:** interpretation of forgetting, repression
- **Cultural-Historical Approach:** analysis of use of cultural tools

Different methods give different types of data. How to integrate them?

**4. Incommensurability of Theories (Kuhn)**

**Problem:**

Kuhn showed that theories of different paradigms are incommensurable:
- **Different Concepts:** different theories use different concepts
- **Different Problems:** different theories solve different problems
- **Different Criteria:** different theories use different evaluation criteria

**Example:** Behaviorism vs. Cognitivism
- **Different Concepts:** stimulus-reaction vs. information processing
- **Different Problems:** learning behavior vs. understanding processes
- **Different Criteria:** objectivity of behavior vs. understanding processes

**Problem:** If theories are incommensurable, how to integrate them?

**Literature:**
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962, Russian trans. 2003)
  - On incommensurability of paradigms

### 3.2. Attempts at Integration

**1. Biopsychosocial Model**

**Main Idea:**

Biopsychosocial model integrates biological, psychological, and social factors:
- **Biological Level:** neurotransmitters, hormones, genetics
- **Psychological Level:** cognitions, emotions, personality
- **Social Level:** family, culture, society

**Example:** Explanation of Depression
- **Biological:** serotonin deficit
- **Psychological:** negative cognitive schemas
- **Social:** stressful life events

**Pros:**

1. **Multi-level:** considers different levels
2. **Comprehensive:** comprehensive understanding of events
3. **Applicability:** applicable to clinical practice

**Problems:**

1. **Eclecticism:** mechanical combination of factors without integration
2. **Priority:** which level has priority?
3. **Interaction:** how do levels interact?

**Problem of Integration:**

Biopsychosocial model may be eclecticism, not integration:
- Mechanical combination of factors
- No unified theory explaining interaction

**Literature:**
- **George Engel, "The Need for a New Medical Model"** (1977, English)
  - On biopsychosocial model

**2. Integrative Psychotherapy**

**Main Idea:**

Integrative psychotherapy unites different approaches:
- **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** changing thoughts and behavior
- **Psychodynamic Therapy:** working with unconscious
- **Humanistic Therapy:** focus on experiences
- **Systemic Therapy:** working with system of relationships

**Example:** Treatment of Anxiety
- **CBT:** changing irrational beliefs
- **Psychodynamic:** working with unconscious conflicts
- **Humanistic:** understanding experiences
- **Systemic:** working with family relationships

**Pros:**

1. **Flexibility:** can choose approach suitable for client
2. **Effectiveness:** different approaches can complement each other
3. **Practicality:** practical application of different techniques

**Problems:**

1. **Eclecticism:** use of techniques without theoretical integration
2. **Contradictions:** different approaches may contradict each other
3. **Choice Criteria:** how to choose approach?

**Problem of Integration:**

Integrative psychotherapy may be eclecticism, not integration:
- Use of techniques from different approaches
- No unified theory explaining why which techniques to use

**Literature:**
- **John Norcross, Michael Goldfried, "Handbook of Psychotherapy Integration"** (2005, English)
  - On integrative psychotherapy

**3. Cognitive-Behavioral Approaches**

**Main Idea:**

Cognitive-behavioral approaches unite cognitivism and behaviorism:
- **Cognitive Component:** changing thoughts, beliefs
- **Behavioral Component:** changing behavior

**Example:** Treatment of Phobia
- **Cognitive:** changing irrational beliefs about fear
- **Behavioral:** gradual exposure to feared object

**Pros:**

1. **Integration:** combining cognitive and behavioral
2. **Effectiveness:** effective for many disorders
3. **Empirical Support:** has empirical support

**Problems:**

1. **Limitation:** does not consider all aspects (unconscious, experiences)
2. **Priority:** which component has priority?
3. **Mechanisms:** how do cognitive and behavioral components interact?

**Problem of Integration:**

Cognitive-behavioral approaches integrate cognitivism and behaviorism, but not all approaches:
- Do not consider psychoanalysis, humanistic approaches
- Integration is limited

**Literature:**
- **Aaron Beck, "Cognitive Therapy of Depression"** (1979, English, Russian trans. 2003)
  - On cognitive-behavioral therapy

**4. Neurophenomenology**

**Main Idea:**

Neurophenomenology unites neuroscience and phenomenology:
- **Neuroscience:** studying neural processes
- **Phenomenology:** studying experiences

**Example:** Studying Consciousness
- **Neuroscience:** neural correlates of consciousness
- **Phenomenology:** experience of consciousness

**Pros:**

1. **Integration:** combining objective and subjective
2. **Novelty:** new approach to problem of consciousness
3. **Potential:** potentially can solve problem of consciousness

**Problems:**

1. **Complexity:** difficult to integrate objective and subjective
2. **Methodology:** how to combine neuroscience and phenomenology?
3. **Testability:** how to test subjective experiences?

**Problem of Integration:**

Neurophenomenology tries to integrate objective and subjective, but it is complex:
- Different epistemologies (objectivity vs. subjectivity)
- Different methods (measurement vs. interpretation)

**Literature:**
- **Francisco Varela, "Neurophenomenology: A Methodological Remedy"** (1996, English)
  - On neurophenomenology

### 3.3. Integration or Eclecticism?

**Main Difference:**

**Integration:**
- Theoretical unification of approaches
- Unified theory explaining interaction
- Understanding differences and compatibility

**Eclecticism:**
- Mechanical combination of approaches without theory
- Use of techniques from different approaches without understanding
- Ignoring incompatibility

**Problem:**

How to distinguish integration from eclecticism?
- **Integration:** unification at theoretical level
- **Eclecticism:** combination at practical level without theory

**Example:** Integrative Psychotherapy
- **Integration:** unified theory explaining which approaches to use
- **Eclecticism:** use of techniques from different approaches without theory

**The Problem in Psychology:**

Many attempts at integration are actually eclecticism:
- Biopsychosocial model: mechanical combination of factors
- Integrative psychotherapy: use of techniques without theory
- How to turn eclecticism into integration?

**Literature:**
- **John Norcross, Michael Goldfried, "Handbook of Psychotherapy Integration"** (2005, English)
  - On difference between integration and eclecticism

### Practical Assignments

1. Analyze an attempt at integration in psychology:
   - Which approaches are integrated?
   - Is this integration or eclecticism?
   - What problems are there?

2. Develop a plan to integrate two approaches:
   - What problems need to be solved?
   - How to integrate ontologies, epistemologies, methods?
   - Is this possible?

3. Compare different attempts at integration:
   - What are their differences?
   - Which is more successful?
   - What problems does each have?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Kuhn's work "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" — this is a classic work on incommensurability of paradigms. Then study attempts at integration in psychology (Engel — biopsychosocial model, Norcross and Goldfried — integrative psychotherapy) — they show how different approaches are attempted to be integrated.
