# Lecture 6: Phenomenon, Hypothesis, Model, Theory: Hierarchy of Scientific Concepts

## 1. Introduction

Scientific knowledge has a hierarchy: from observing a phenomenon to constructing a theory. How is this path structured? What stages are on it? How are phenomenon, hypothesis, model, and theory related?

In this lecture, we will examine the hierarchy of scientific concepts: **phenomenon** → **hypothesis** → **model** → **theory**. We will trace the path from observing a phenomenon to constructing an explanatory system using examples from psychology.

**Lecture goal:** Understand the hierarchy of scientific concepts, the path from phenomenon to theory, and how they are related in scientific knowledge.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Hierarchy of Scientific Concepts

**Why is this important?**

Scientific knowledge does not arise from nothing — it develops from simple to complex:
- First we **observe** a phenomenon — something happens
- Then we formulate a **hypothesis** — an assumption about why this happens
- Then we build a **model** — a simplified representation of mechanisms
- Finally, we create a **theory** — a system of interconnected statements

How is this path structured? What stages are on it? These are fundamental questions of methodology.

**The Problem of Beginning:**

**Where do phenomena come from?**
- Observation? But what do we observe? Depends on theory
- Chance? But how to distinguish important from random?
- Problem? But where do problems come from?

**The Problem of Transition:**

How to move from phenomenon to hypothesis? From hypothesis to model? From model to theory?
- **Induction:** generalization from particular to general? But the problem of induction
- **Deduction:** inference from general to particular? But where does the general come from?
- **Abduction:** choosing the best explanation? But by what criteria?

**The Problem of Validity:**

How to verify validity at each level?
- **Phenomenon:** is the phenomenon real? Not an artifact?
- **Hypothesis:** is it confirmed by data?
- **Model:** does it correspond to reality?
- **Theory:** does it explain phenomena? Predict new facts?

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many phenomena are ambiguous — can be interpreted differently
- Hypotheses are often difficult to test — unobservable variables
- Models simplify reality — what is lost?
- Theories compete — how to choose the correct one?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand the hierarchy and problems of each level.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Phenomenon: Observable Event

**What is a Phenomenon?**

A phenomenon is an observable event requiring explanation. Something happens that attracts the researcher's attention.

**Characteristics of a Phenomenon:**

1. **Observability:** phenomenon must be observable (directly or indirectly)

2. **Repeatability:** phenomenon must repeat or be reproducible (at least potentially)

3. **Problematicity:** phenomenon must raise questions, require explanation

4. **Importance:** phenomenon must be significant for understanding events

**Examples of Phenomena from Psychology:**

1. **Stroop Effect (Stroop, 1935):**
   - **Observation:** people are slower to name word color when the word denotes a different color
   - **Example:** word "red" is written in blue — people are slower to say "blue"
   - **Problem:** why does this happen? What does this say about attention and automatic processing?

2. **False Memory Effect (Loftus, 1975):**
   - **Observation:** people "remember" events that did not happen after post-event information
   - **Example:** people "remember" seeing a STOP sign, although there was none
   - **Problem:** why does this happen? What does this say about memory?

3. **Conformity (Asch, 1951):**
   - **Observation:** people agree with group's incorrect answers, even if they know the correct answer
   - **Example:** group says line A is longer than B, although B is clearly longer
   - **Problem:** why do people conform to the group? What does this say about social influence?

4. **Fundamental Attribution Error Effect (Ross, 1977):**
   - **Observation:** people tend to explain others' behavior by internal causes, not situational ones
   - **Example:** we explain others' behavior by personality traits, but our own by situation
   - **Problem:** why does this happen? What does this say about social cognition?

**The Problem of Phenomenon Detection:**

**1. Theory-Ladenness:**
- What we consider a phenomenon depends on our theories
- Different theories see different phenomena

**2. Problem of Artifacts:**
- Phenomenon may be a method artifact, not a real event
- How to distinguish phenomenon from artifact?

**3. Problem of Significance:**
- Not all observable events are significant
- How to determine if a phenomenon is worth studying?

**Literature:**
- **John Stroop, "Studies of Interference in Serial Verbal Reactions"** (1935, English)
  - Classic study of Stroop effect
- **Elizabeth Loftus, "Creating False Memories"** (1975, English, Russian trans. in collections)
  - Classic study of false memory effect
- **Solomon Asch, "Studies of Independence and Conformity"** (1951, English)
  - Classic study of conformity

### 3.2. Hypothesis: Assumption About Connection

**What is a Hypothesis?**

A hypothesis is an assumption about a connection between variables. This is an attempt to explain a phenomenon.

**Characteristics of a Hypothesis:**

1. **Testability:** hypothesis must be empirically testable

2. **Specificity:** hypothesis must be concrete, not vague

3. **Justification:** hypothesis must be justified by theory or data

4. **Falsifiability:** hypothesis must be falsifiable (can imagine data that would refute it)

**Types of Hypotheses:**

1. **Descriptive:** describe connections between variables
   - Example: "People with high anxiety have lower self-esteem"

2. **Explanatory:** explain mechanisms of connection
   - Example: "Anxiety reduces self-esteem through negative self-perception"

3. **Predictive:** predict results under certain conditions
   - Example: "If anxiety is increased, self-esteem will decrease"

**Examples of Hypotheses from Psychology:**

1. **Stroop Effect:**
   - **Hypothesis 1:** automatic word processing interferes with color naming
   - **Hypothesis 2:** conflict between automatic and controlled processing
   - **Hypothesis 3:** different speeds of color and word processing

2. **False Memory Effect:**
   - **Hypothesis:** post-event information changes existing memories
   - **Mechanism:** information integrates into existing memory schemas

3. **Conformity:**
   - **Hypothesis:** people conform to group due to norm pressure or uncertainty
   - **Mechanism:** social influence through informational or normative pressure

**The Problem of Hypothesis Formulation:**

**1. Problem of Origin:**
- Where do hypotheses come from? Intuition? Theory? Data?
- How to choose from many possible hypotheses?

**2. Problem of Testability:**
- Some hypotheses are difficult to test
- How to test hypotheses about unobservable variables?

**3. Problem of Specificity:**
- Hypotheses must be concrete enough for testing
- But not too concrete to be interesting

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 2: "Method of Constructing and Testing Theories" — on the role of hypotheses
- **Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes"** (1970)
  - On hypotheses as part of protective belt

### 3.3. Model: Simplified Representation

**What is a Model?**

A model is a simplified representation of reality showing main mechanisms of an event. Model simplifies complexity, highlighting key elements.

**Characteristics of a Model:**

1. **Simplification:** model simplifies reality, highlighting important elements

2. **Representativeness:** model should represent key aspects of the event

3. **Predictive Power:** model should predict system behavior

4. **Explanatory Power:** model should explain mechanisms of the event

**Types of Models:**

1. **Conceptual:** verbal descriptions of mechanisms
   - Example: Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model (sensory → short-term → long-term)

2. **Mathematical:** mathematical equations describing connections
   - Example: Ebbinghaus forgetting model (exponential function)

3. **Computational:** computer simulations of mechanisms
   - Example: information processing models, neural networks

4. **Diagrams:** graphic representations of structure and processes
   - Example: cognitive process diagrams, memory maps

**Examples of Models from Psychology:**

1. **Atkinson-Shiffrin Memory Model (1968):**
   - **Structure:** sensory memory → short-term memory → long-term memory
   - **Mechanisms:** encoding, storage, retrieval
   - **Simplifications:** does not account for all aspects of memory, focuses on structure

2. **Information Processing Model (Newell & Simon, 1972):**
   - **Structure:** input → processing → output
   - **Mechanisms:** encoding, decoding, transformation
   - **Simplifications:** simplifies complexity of cognitive processes

3. **Dual-Process Model (Evans, 2008):**
   - **Structure:** System 1 (fast, automatic) and System 2 (slow, controlled)
   - **Mechanisms:** different types of information processing
   - **Simplifications:** simplifies complexity of thinking

**The Problem of Modeling:**

**1. Problem of Simplification:**
- Model simplifies reality — what is lost?
- How to determine what is important and what is not?

**2. Problem of Validity:**
- Does model correspond to reality?
- How to test model validity?

**3. Problem of Multiplicity:**
- Different models of the same event may exist
- How to choose the best model?

**Literature:**
- **Richard Atkinson, Richard Shiffrin, "Human Memory: A Proposed System and Its Control Processes"** (1968, English)
  - Classic memory model
- **Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, "Human Problem Solving"** (1972, English)
  - On modeling cognitive processes
- **Daniel Kahneman, "Thinking, Fast and Slow"** (2011, Engl. trans. 2013)
  - On dual-process model

### 3.4. Theory: Explanatory System

**What is a Theory?**

A theory is a system of interconnected statements that explains and predicts events. Theory integrates phenomena, hypotheses, and models into a unified system.

**Characteristics of a Theory:**

1. **Systematicity:** theory must be systematic, not random

2. **Explanatory Power:** theory must explain events

3. **Predictive Power:** theory must predict new facts

4. **Coherence:** theory must link different phenomena and models

**Structure of Theory:**

1. **Basic Principles:** irrefutable assumptions of theory

2. **Laws:** regularities, connections between events

3. **Models:** simplified representations of mechanisms

4. **Hypotheses:** testable predictions

5. **Phenomena:** explained events

**Examples of Theories from Psychology:**

1. **Cognitive Dissonance Theory (Festinger, 1957):**
   - **Basic Principle:** people strive for consonance, avoid dissonance
   - **Laws:** dissonance arises when cognitions are inconsistent
   - **Models:** models of processes of cognitive change
   - **Hypotheses:** under dissonance, people will change beliefs or behavior
   - **Phenomena:** explains many phenomena (effort justification, post-decision dissonance)

2. **Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977):**
   - **Basic Principle:** learning occurs through observation and modeling
   - **Laws:** observation affects behavior through attention, retention, reproduction
   - **Models:** models of learning processes through observation
   - **Hypotheses:** observation affects behavior, especially when model is reinforced
   - **Phenomena:** explains social learning, aggression, altruism

3. **Information Processing Theory:**
   - **Basic Principle:** mind processes information
   - **Laws:** laws of information processing (attention, memory, problem solving)
   - **Models:** cognitive architecture models
   - **Hypotheses:** predictions about speed and accuracy of processing
   - **Phenomena:** explains many cognitive phenomena

**Hierarchy: Phenomenon → Hypothesis → Model → Theory**

```
Phenomenon (observation)
  ↓
Hypothesis (assumption about connection)
  ↓
Model (simplified representation of mechanisms)
  ↓
Theory (explanatory system)
```

**Example Path:** False Memory Effect

1. **Phenomenon:** people "remember" events that did not happen
2. **Hypothesis:** post-event information changes memories
3. **Model:** reconstructive memory model (information integrates into schemas)
4. **Theory:** reconstructive memory theory (memory is reconstructive, not reproductive)

**The Problem of Theory:**

**1. Problem of Generalization:**
- How to generalize from specific phenomena to general theory?
- Problem of induction: particular cases do not prove general

**2. Problem of Testing:**
- How to test theory? Through hypotheses? But hypotheses may be incomplete
- Problem of falsification: theory is defended from falsification

**3. Problem of Competition:**
- Different theories can explain the same phenomena
- How to choose the correct theory?

**Literature:**
- **Leon Festinger, "A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance"** (1957, English, Russian trans. 1999)
  - Classic cognitive dissonance theory
- **Albert Bandura, "Social Learning Theory"** (1977, English, Russian trans. 2000)

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose a specific psychological research and trace the path from phenomenon to theory:
   - What phenomenon was observed?
   - What hypotheses were formulated?
   - What models were used?
   - What theory does the research belong to?

2. Analyze the hierarchy of scientific concepts in a specific area of psychology:
   - What phenomena are studied?
   - What hypotheses are tested?
   - What models are used?
   - What theories explain events?

3. Compare different theories of the same event:
   - How do they explain phenomena?
   - What hypotheses do they formulate?
   - What models do they use?
   - How can one choose between them?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading classic studies (Stroop, Loftus, Asch) — they well show the path from phenomenon to theory. Then study specific models and theories (Atkinson-Shiffrin, Festinger, Bandura) — they show how models and theories are constructed.
