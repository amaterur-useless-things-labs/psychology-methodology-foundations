# Lecture 5: Theoretical and Empirical Levels of Scientific Knowledge

## 1. Introduction

Scientific knowledge has structure: it exists at different levels — empirical and theoretical. The empirical level is observations, data, facts. The theoretical level is concepts, patterns, models, theories.

How are these levels related? Can we collect facts without theory? How do theoretical assumptions influence observations? These questions are fundamental to understanding psychology methodology.

In this lecture, we will examine the structure of scientific knowledge: empirical and theoretical levels, their differences, interconnections, and problems of each level.

**Lecture goal:** Understand the structure of scientific knowledge, differences between empirical and theoretical levels, and problems of their interconnection.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Levels of Scientific Knowledge

**Why is this important?**

Science works at different levels:
- **Empirical level:** we see, measure, collect data
- **Theoretical level:** we explain, predict, build models

But how are these levels related? This is a fundamental question of methodology.

**The Problem of Level Differences:**

**Empirical Level:**
- What do we observe? Data, facts
- How do we obtain them? Observation, experiment, measurement
- What can we say? Description of phenomena

**Theoretical Level:**
- What do we explain? Concepts, patterns
- How do we build them? Abstraction, modeling, generalization
- What can we say? Explanation and prediction of phenomena

**The Problem of Connection:**

These levels are interdependent:
- **Empirics** is needed to test theory, but what counts as a fact depends on theory
- **Theory** is needed to interpret data, but theories are built on the basis of empirics

This creates a **hermeneutic circle**: it is impossible to start without both levels, but they depend on each other.

**The Problem of Theory-Ladenness:**

Observations are not neutral — they are theory-laden:
- What we see depends on our theories
- The same data can be interpreted differently
- "Pure facts" do not exist — facts are always interpreted

**Example:** Milgram Experiment (obedience to authority):
- **Empirical data:** 65% of participants continued administering shocks to the end
- **Theoretical interpretation:**
  - Position 1: people tend to obey authority
  - Position 2: situational factors affect behavior
  - Position 3: people follow social norms

Same data, different theoretical interpretations.

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem of levels is especially acute:
- Many psychological phenomena are not directly observable (thoughts, feelings, unconscious)
- Operationalization is required — definition of theoretical concepts through observable variables
- Operationalization depends on theory, which creates a circularity problem

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand the structure of levels and problems of their interconnection.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Empirical Level: Observations, Data, Facts

**What is the Empirical Level?**

The empirical level is the level of observations, data, facts obtained through experience (observation, experiment, measurement).

**Structure of the Empirical Level:**

1. **Observations:** direct perception of phenomena
   - What do we see? Hear? Feel?
   - Example: experiment participant presses a button

2. **Data:** recorded observations
   - Numbers, records, reports
   - Example: reaction time 250 ms, number of correct answers 8 out of 10

3. **Facts:** interpreted data, accepted by community as true
   - Data organized into a system
   - Example: Stroop effect exists — people are slower to name word color when the word denotes a different color

**Characteristics of the Empirical Level:**

1. **Concreteness:** empirics is concrete — relates to specific cases, situations, people

2. **Observability:** empirics is observable — can be seen, measured, recorded

3. **Particularity:** empirics is particular — describes individual cases, not general patterns

4. **Dependence on Method:** empirics depends on the method of obtaining data — different methods give different data

**Problems of the Empirical Level:**

1. **Theory-Ladenness:** observations are not neutral — they depend on theories
   - What we see depends on what we are looking for
   - The same data can be interpreted differently

2. **Problem of Basic Statements:** what counts as "observation"?
   - Observations depend on theories
   - There are no absolute "basic statements"

3. **Problem of Measurement:** in psychology, measurement is problematic
   - Many phenomena are not directly observable
   - Operationalization is required — definition through observable variables
   - Operationalization depends on theory

4. **Problem of Generalization:** empirics is particular — how to generalize to other cases?
   - Can we generalize research results?
   - To whom/what can we generalize?

**Examples from Psychology:**

**Empirical Data:**
- Reaction time in experiment: 250 ms
- Number of correct answers in test: 8 out of 10
- Survey results: 75% of respondents agree with statement

**Facts:**
- Stroop effect exists
- Short-term memory has limited capacity (7±2 items)
- People tend to commit fundamental attribution error

- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 5: "The Problem of the Empirical Basis" — on basic statements
- **Norwood Hanson, "Patterns of Discovery"** (1958, English)
  - Chapter 1: "Observation" — on theory-ladenness of observations
- **Willard Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"** (1951, English, Russian trans. in "Philosophy of Science", 1996)
  - On theory-ladenness of observations

### 3.2. Theoretical Level: Concepts, Patterns, Models

**What is the Theoretical Level?**

The theoretical level is the level of concepts, patterns, models, theories that explain and predict phenomena.

**Structure of the Theoretical Level:**

1. **Concepts:** abstract representations of phenomena
   - Examples: "memory", "motivation", "personality", "intelligence"
   - Characteristics: abstract, generalized, not reducible to specific observations

2. **Models:** simplified representations of reality
   - Examples: Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, information processing model
   - Characteristics: simplify reality, show main mechanisms

3. **Laws:** regularities, connections between phenomena
   - Examples: Thorndike's law of effect, Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve
   - Characteristics: general, regular, predict phenomena

4. **Theories:** systems of interconnected statements
   - Examples: cognitive dissonance theory, social learning theory
   - Characteristics: explain phenomena, predict new facts

**Characteristics of the Theoretical Level:**

1. **Abstraction:** theories are abstract — do not describe specific cases, but general patterns

2. **Generality:** theories are general — apply to many cases, situations

3. **Explanatory Power:** theories explain why phenomena occur

4. **Predictive Power:** theories predict what will happen under certain conditions

**Functions of the Theoretical Level:**

1. **Explanation:** theory explains why phenomena occur
   - Example: cognitive dissonance theory explains why people change opinions after making a decision

2. **Prediction:** theory predicts what will happen under certain conditions
   - Example: reinforcement theory predicts that behavior reinforced by reward will be repeated

3. **Organization:** theory links different facts into a unified system
   - Example: Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model links different facts about memory into a unified system

4. **Direction of Research:** theory indicates what to study, what hypotheses to test
   - Example: social learning theory indicates importance of observation and modeling

**Problems of the Theoretical Level:**

1. **Abstraction:** theories are abstract — do not describe specific phenomena, but general patterns
   - Problem: how to test abstract theories with concrete data?

2. **Incompleteness:** theories do not describe all aspects of phenomena — they simplify reality
   - Problem: what is lost in simplification?

3. **Competition:** different theories can explain the same phenomena differently
   - Problem: how to choose the correct theory?

4. **Variability:** theories develop, change, are replaced by new ones
   - Problem: if theories change, can we consider them true?

**Examples from Psychology:**

**Concepts:**
- Memory: ability to store and reproduce information
- Motivation: internal processes that prompt action
- Personality: stable individual differences in behavior

**Models:**
- Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model: sensory memory → short-term memory → long-term memory
- Information processing model: input → processing → output

**Laws:**
- Law of effect (Thorndike): behavior leading to pleasant consequences is reinforced
- Forgetting curve (Ebbinghaus): forgetting follows a curve, fastest immediately after learning

**Theories:**
- Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger): people strive for consonance, avoid dissonance
- Social learning theory (Bandura): learning through observation and modeling

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 3: "Theories" — on structure and functions of theories
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962, Engl. trans. 2003)
  - Chapter 3: "Normal Science" — on the role of theories in science
- **Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes"** (1970)
  - On structure of research programs and theories

### 3.3. The Problem of Theory-Ladenness of Observations

**Main Idea:**

Observations are not neutral — they are theory-laden. What we see depends on our theories.

**Theory-Ladenness of Observations:**

Observations depend on:
1. **Theories:** what we look for depends on our theories
2. **Language:** how we describe depends on language and concepts
3. **Methods:** what we see depends on methods
4. **Context:** interpretation depends on context

**Examples:**

**1. Perception:** Two researchers look at the same thing, but see differently:
- **Behaviorist:** sees stimulus → response
- **Cognitivist:** sees information processing, schemas, models

**2. Data Interpretation:** The same data can be interpreted differently:
- **Milgram Experiment:**
  - **Interpretation 1:** people tend to obey authority
  - **Interpretation 2:** situational factors affect behavior
  - **Interpretation 3:** people follow social norms

**3. Measurement:** Measurement depends on theory:
- **Measuring Intelligence:** IQ tests assume a theory of intelligence
- **Measuring Personality Traits:** questionnaires assume a theory of personality

**Consequences:**

1. **No Neutral Observation:** All observations are theory-laden

2. **Data Do Not Determine Theory:** The same data can be interpreted differently

3. **Theory Influences Interpretation:** Different theories give different interpretations of the same data

4. **Problem of Objectivity:** If observations are theory-laden, is objectivity possible?

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many phenomena are not directly observable (thoughts, feelings, unconscious)
- Operationalization is required — definition of theoretical concepts through observable variables
- Operationalization depends on theory, which creates a circularity problem

**Example:** Studying Aggression:
- **Theory:** aggression is intentional harm to another
- **Operationalization:** number of hits on Bobo doll (Bandura), questionnaire responses, behavior observation
- **Problem:** operationalization depends on theory, but theory is tested through operationalized data

**Literature:**
- **Norwood Hanson, "Patterns of Discovery"** (1958, English)
  - Chapter 1: "Observation" — on theory-ladenness of observations
- **Willard Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"** (1951, English, Russian trans. in "Philosophy of Science", 1996)
  - On theory-ladenness of observations

### 3.4. Interconnection Between Empirical and Theoretical Levels

**Hermeneutic Circle in Science:**

Empirical and theoretical levels are interdependent — create a "hermeneutic circle":
- **Empirics** is needed to test theory, but what counts as a fact depends on theory
- **Theory** is needed to interpret data, but theories are built on the basis of empirics

**How Levels Work Together:**

Scientific research is a cyclic process:

1. **Theory** → formulates hypotheses, predictions
2. **Empirics** → obtains data, tests hypotheses
3. **Interpretation** → interprets data through the lens of theory
4. **Feedback** → results affect theory, new questions

**Example Cycle:** Studying False Memory Effect (Loftus):

1. **Theory:** memory is reconstructive, influenced by post-event information
2. **Hypothesis:** post-event information can change memories
3. **Empirics:** experiment, video showing, post-event information, memory test
4. **Data:** number of false memories
5. **Interpretation:** memory is reconstructive, influenced by post-event information
6. **Feedback:** theory confirmed, new questions about mechanisms

**The Problem of Priority:**

**Position 1: Empirics is Primary (Empiricism)**
- First we collect facts, then we build theories
- Problem: can we collect facts without theory? What counts as a fact?

**Position 2: Theory is Primary (Rationalism)**
- First we build theories, then we verify them with facts
- Problem: where do theories come from? How to verify them without data?

**Realistic Position:**

Empirics and theory are interdependent:
- No absolute priority
- They develop together
- Scientific research is a cyclic process

**Literature:**
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 1: on demarcation problem and interconnection of theory and empirics
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962, Engl. trans. 2003)
  - Chapter 4: "Normal Science as Puzzle-Solving" — on the role of theory in research

   - What theoretical concepts are used?
   - How are data interpreted through the lens of theory?
   - How do theoretical assumptions influence interpretation?

2. Analyze the problem of theory-ladenness of observations:
   - Provide examples when different theories give different interpretations of the same data
   - How does this affect research objectivity?

3. Think about interconnection of empirical and theoretical levels:
   - Can research start without both levels?
   - How do they develop together?
