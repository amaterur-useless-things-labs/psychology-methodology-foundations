# Lecture 18: Paradigms and Research Programs (Kuhn, Lakatos)

## 1. Introduction

How does science develop? Gradually and cumulatively, accumulating knowledge? Or through revolutions, changes of paradigms? Thomas Kuhn and Imre Lakatos proposed different models of science development.

In this lecture, we will examine theories of science development: Kuhn's concept of paradigms (normal science, crisis, revolution), Lakatos's methodology of research programs (hard core, protective belt, progressive and regressive shifts), and their application to psychology.

**Lecture goal:** Understand how science develops according to Kuhn and Lakatos, what paradigms and research programs are, and how they are applicable to psychology.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Science Development

**Why is this important?**

How does science develop? Different philosophers of science give different answers:
- **Cumulativism:** science develops gradually, accumulating knowledge
- **Revolutionism:** science develops through revolutions, changes of paradigms
- **Evolutionism:** science develops evolutionarily, through competition of programs

Which approach is correct? How does psychology develop?

**The Problem of Development:**

**Position 1: Cumulative Development (Logical Positivism)**
- Science develops gradually, accumulating knowledge
- New theories include old ones as special cases
- Example: theory of relativity includes Newtonian mechanics

**Position 2: Revolutionary Development (Kuhn)**
- Science develops through revolutions, changes of paradigms
- New paradigms are incompatible with old ones
- Example: Copernican revolution replaced Ptolemaic system

**Position 3: Evolutionary Development (Lakatos)**
- Science develops through competition of research programs
- Programs progress or regress
- Example: competition of programs in physics

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many competing approaches
- No single dominant paradigm
- How does psychology develop?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different models give different answers. It is important to understand various models of science development and their application to psychology.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Thomas Kuhn's Concept of Paradigms

**Main Idea:**

Kuhn proposed a model of science development through changes of paradigms:
- **Paradigm:** set of beliefs, values, techniques shared by scientific community
- **Normal Science:** work within paradigm
- **Crisis:** accumulation of anomalies not explainable by paradigm
- **Revolution:** change of paradigm to new one

**Structure of Scientific Revolutions:**

1. **Pre-Science:**
   - No unified paradigm
   - Various approaches compete
   - Example: pre-psychology before Wundt

2. **Normal Science:**
   - There is dominant paradigm
   - Scientists solve puzzles within paradigm
   - Paradigm sets questions, methods, evaluation criteria
   - Example: work within behaviorism, cognitivism

3. **Crisis:**
   - Accumulation of anomalies not explainable by paradigm
   - Paradigm stops working
   - Alternative approaches arise
   - Example: crisis of behaviorism (cognitive revolution)

4. **Revolution:**
   - Change of paradigm to new one
   - New paradigm incompatible with old one
   - Change in worldview of scientists occurs
   - Example: cognitive revolution replaced behaviorism

5. **New Normal Science:**
   - Work within new paradigm
   - Cycle repeats

**Characteristics of Paradigm:**

1. **Metaphysical Beliefs:**
   - Representations of reality
   - Example: behaviorism — behavior is real, psyche is black box

2. **Epistemological Principles:**
   - How to know?
   - Example: behaviorism — through observation, experiment

3. **Methods:**
   - What methods to use?
   - Example: behaviorism — experiment, observation

4. **Examples (Exemplars):**
   - Classic examples of problem solving
   - Example: Pavlov's, Skinner's experiments

5. **Values:**
   - What is valuable in science?
   - Example: behaviorism — objectivity, predictability

**Incommensurability of Paradigms:**

Paradigms are incommensurable:
- **Different Concepts:** different theories use different concepts
- **Different Problems:** different theories solve different problems
- **Different Criteria:** different theories use different evaluation criteria
- **Different Worlds:** scientists in different paradigms see different worlds

**Example:** Behaviorism vs. Cognitivism
- **Different Concepts:** stimulus-reaction vs. information processing
- **Different Problems:** learning behavior vs. understanding processes
- **Different Criteria:** objectivity of behavior vs. understanding processes

**The Problem of Incommensurability:**

If paradigms are incommensurable, how can they be compared?
- No neutral language for comparison
- No objective criteria for choice
- Choice of paradigm depends on beliefs, values, social factors

**Literature:**
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962, Russian trans. 2003)
  - Classic work on paradigms and scientific revolutions

### 3.2. Imre Lakatos's Methodology of Research Programs

**Main Idea:**

Lakatos proposed a model of science development through competition of research programs:
- **Research Program:** series of theories connected by common hard core
- **Hard Core:** irrefutable principles of program
- **Protective Belt:** auxiliary hypotheses that can change
- **Progressive Shift:** program predicts new facts
- **Regressive Shift:** program only explains known facts

**Structure of Research Program:**

1. **Hard Core:**
   - Irrefutable principles of program
   - Cannot be changed without abandoning program
   - Protected from falsification
   - Example: in behaviorism — principle of behavior determinism

2. **Protective Belt:**
   - Auxiliary hypotheses
   - Can be changed to protect core
   - Testable and falsifiable
   - Example: specific hypotheses about reinforcement

3. **Heuristic:**
   - Rules guiding research
   - Positive heuristic: what to do (what problems to solve)
   - Negative heuristic: what not to do (don't touch core)
   - Example: behaviorism — study behavior, not psyche

**Types of Shifts:**

1. **Progressive Shift:**
   - Program predicts new facts
   - Predictions confirmed
   - Program grows, explains more events
   - Example: behaviorism predicted effects of reinforcement

2. **Regressive Shift:**
   - Program only explains known facts
   - Does not predict new facts
   - Program defends from anomalies with ad hoc hypotheses
   - Example: behaviorism defended from cognitive events with ad hoc hypotheses

**Competition of Programs:**

Programs compete with each other:
- Progressive program wins regressive one
- But programs can coexist for long time
- Regressive program can become progressive

**Evaluation of Programs:**

Program evaluated by:
- **Progressiveness:** does it predict new facts?
- **Empirical Support:** are predictions confirmed?
- **Heuristic Power:** is program fruitful?

**Literature:**
- **Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and Methodology of Scientific Research Programs"** (1970)
  - Classic work on methodology of research programs

### 3.3. Application to Psychology

**Paradigms in Psychology:**

In psychology, various paradigms can be distinguished:

1. **Behaviorism:**
   - **Hard Core:** behavior determined by stimuli, psyche is black box
   - **Protective Belt:** specific hypotheses about reinforcement, learning
   - **Heuristic:** study behavior, not psyche
   - **Status:** was dominant paradigm, then crisis, change to cognitivism

2. **Cognitivism:**
   - **Hard Core:** psyche processes information
   - **Protective Belt:** specific models of cognitive processes
   - **Heuristic:** study cognitive processes, structures
   - **Status:** dominant paradigm now

3. **Psychoanalysis:**
   - **Hard Core:** unconscious is real, influences behavior
   - **Protective Belt:** specific theories of unconscious, defense mechanisms
   - **Heuristic:** interpret unconscious
   - **Status:** separate research program, not dominant

4. **Cultural-Historical Approach:**
   - **Hard Core:** psyche is product of activity, culture
   - **Protective Belt:** specific theories of development, activity
   - **Heuristic:** study psyche in context of culture, history
   - **Status:** separate research program

**Crises and Revolutions in Psychology:**

1. **Crisis of Introspectionism (early 20th century):**
   - Introspectionism could not solve problem of objectivity
   - Alternatives arose: behaviorism, Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis

2. **Cognitive Revolution (1950s-1960s):**
   - Crisis of behaviorism (could not explain language, thinking)
   - Cognitivism arose as alternative

3. **Modern Crisis?**
   - Replication crisis
   - Crisis of trust in psychology
   - Emergence of alternatives (open science, preregistration)

**The Problem of Multiplicity of Paradigms:**

In psychology there is no single dominant paradigm:
- Different paradigms coexist
- Different paradigms study different aspects
- Can this be considered normal state?

**Kuhn vs. Lakatos in Psychology:**

**Kuhn's Position:**
- In psychology there is no single paradigm
- Psychology has not yet reached normal science
- Or psychology is experiencing crisis

**Lakatos's Position:**
- In psychology there are many research programs
- Programs compete with each other
- Some programs progressive, others regressive

**Literature:**
- **David Palermo, "Psychology as Science: Paradigms and Problems"** (1971, English)
  - On application of concept of paradigms to psychology

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose psychological approach and analyze it as paradigm:
   - What beliefs, values, methods?
   - What examples (exemplars)?
   - What heuristic?

2. Choose psychological approach and analyze it as research program:
   - What hard core?
   - What protective belt?
   - Progressive or regressive program?

3. Compare Kuhn's and Lakatos's approaches:
   - What are their differences?
   - Which approach better applicable to psychology?
   - Can they be integrated?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Kuhn's work "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" — this is a classic work on paradigms. Then study Lakatos's work "Falsification and Methodology of Scientific Research Programs" — this is alternative to Kuhn. Then consider application to psychology (Palermo, Gholson) — they show how to apply concepts to psychology.
