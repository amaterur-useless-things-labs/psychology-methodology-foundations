# Lecture 16: Multi-Level Analysis (Neuro – Cognitive – Personality – Culture)

## 1. Introduction

Psychological events can be studied at different levels: from neural processes to cultural contexts. How are these levels connected? Can one level be reduced to another? How to integrate analysis at different levels?

In this lecture, we will examine multi-level analysis in psychology: levels of analysis (neuro, cognitive, personality, social, cultural), the problem of reduction (can psychology be reduced to biology?), connection between levels (emergent properties), and examples of analysis at different levels.

**Lecture goal:** Understand multi-level analysis in psychology, how different levels are connected, and problems of reduction and integration.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Multi-Level Analysis

**Why is this important?**

Psychological events can be studied at different levels:
- **Neural Level:** neurotransmitters, synapses, brain regions
- **Cognitive Level:** information processing processes, schemas, models
- **Personality Level:** traits, motives, identity
- **Social Level:** relationships, groups, interactions
- **Cultural Level:** culture, history, society

How are these levels connected? Can one be reduced to another? How to integrate analysis?

**The Problem of Reduction:**

**Position 1: Reduction is Possible (Reductionism)**
- Psychology can be reduced to biology
- Psyche = brain activity
- Example: consciousness = neuron activity

**Position 2: Reduction is Impossible (Anti-Reductionism)**
- Psychological events cannot be reduced to biological
- There are emergent properties
- Example: consciousness cannot be reduced to neuron activity

**The Problem of Connection Between Levels:**

How are levels connected?
- **Bottom-Up Causality:** lower levels influence upper levels
  - Example: neurons → cognitive processes → behavior
- **Top-Down Causality:** upper levels influence lower levels
  - Example: culture → personality → cognitive processes → neurons

How to combine bottom-up and top-down causality?

**The Problem of Integration:**

How to integrate analysis at different levels?
- Different levels require different methods
- Different levels give different types of data
- How to integrate results?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand multi-level nature and problems of integration.

### 3.2. The Problem of Reduction: Can Psychology be Reduced to Biology?

**1. Reductionism**

**Main Idea:**

Reductionism asserts that psychological events can be reduced to biological:
- **Ontological Reductionism:** psyche = brain activity
- **Methodological Reductionism:** psychology can be studied through biology
- **Epistemological Reductionism:** psychological theories can be reduced to biological

**Arguments for Reductionism:**

1. **Unity of Matter:**
   - Everything is material, psyche is also material
   - Psyche = brain activity

2. **Success of Neuroscience:**
   - Neuroscience successfully explains many psychological events
   - Example: neural mechanisms of memory, emotions

3. **Parsimony:**
   - Reduction simplifies explanation
   - No need for separate psychological theories

**Problems of Reductionism:**

1. **Emergent Properties:**
   - There are properties that cannot be reduced to lower levels
   - Example: consciousness cannot be reduced to neuron activity

2. **Multiple Realizability:**
   - Same psychological process can be realized differently
   - Example: memory can be realized differently in different species

3. **Contextuality:**
   - Psychological events depend on context
   - Example: behavior depends on social context

**Literature:**
- **John Bickle, "Philosophy of Science and Neuroscience"** (2009, English)
  - On reductionism in neuroscience

**2. Anti-Reductionism**

**Main Idea:**

Anti-reductionism asserts that psychological events cannot be reduced to biological:
- **Emergent Properties:** there are properties that arise at higher levels
- **Autonomy of Levels:** each level has its laws
- **Necessity of Different Methods:** need different methods for different levels

**Arguments for Anti-Reductionism:**

1. **Emergent Properties:**
   - Properties of whole cannot be reduced to properties of parts
   - Example: consciousness is emergent property of brain

2. **Multiple Realizability:**
   - Same psychological process can be realized differently
   - Psychological level necessary for explanation

3. **Functionality:**
   - Functions are important, not structures
   - Functions cannot be reduced to structures

**Problems of Anti-Reductionism:**

1. **Dualism:**
   - May lead to dualism (psyche ≠ matter)
   - Problem of interaction

2. **Isolation:**
   - May isolate levels from each other
   - Ignoring biological factors

3. **Vitalism:**
   - May lead to vitalism (life force)
   - Unscientific

**Literature:**
- **Jerry Fodor, "Special Sciences"** (1974, English)
  - On anti-reductionism and autonomy of levels

**3. Complementarianism (Mutual Complementarity)**

**Main Idea:**

Complementarianism asserts that levels complement each other:
- **Different Levels Study Different Aspects:**
  - Biology: mechanisms
  - Psychology: processes, experiences
- **Levels Do Not Compete, But Complement:**
  - Both levels needed for complete understanding
- **Integration, Not Reduction:**
  - Integrate levels, not reduce one to another

**Example:** Studying Memory
- **Biological Level:** neural mechanisms (LTP, consolidation)
- **Psychological Level:** cognitive processes (encoding, storage, retrieval)
- **Both Levels Necessary:** biology explains mechanisms, psychology explains processes

**Pros of Complementarianism:**

1. **Completeness:** considers different aspects of event
2. **Integration:** integrates levels, does not isolate them
3. **Flexibility:** allows use of different methods

**Problems of Complementarianism:**

1. **Integration:** how to integrate levels?
2. **Priority:** which level has priority?
3. **Interaction:** how do levels interact?

**Literature:**
- **John Bickle, "Philosophy of Science and Neuroscience"** (2009, English)
  - On complementarianism in neuroscience

### 3.3. Connection Between Levels: Emergent Properties

**What are Emergent Properties?**

Emergent properties are properties of whole that cannot be reduced to properties of parts. They arise at higher levels and do not exist at lower levels.

**Examples of Emergent Properties:**

1. **Consciousness:**
   - Consciousness arises from neuron activity
   - But consciousness cannot be reduced to activity of individual neurons
   - Consciousness is emergent property of brain

2. **Memory:**
   - Memory arises from neural mechanisms
   - But memory cannot be reduced to individual synapses
   - Memory is emergent property of cognitive system

3. **Personality:**
   - Personality arises from cognitive processes and social factors
   - But personality cannot be reduced to individual processes or factors
   - Personality is emergent property of system

**Characteristics of Emergent Properties:**

1. **Irreducibility:**
   - Cannot be reduced to properties of parts
   - Exist only at level of whole

2. **Novelty:**
   - New properties that do not exist at lower levels
   - Arise from interaction of parts

3. **Dependence:**
   - Depend on lower levels
   - But cannot be explained only by them

**Bottom-Up and Top-Down Causality:**

**Bottom-Up Causality:**
- Lower levels influence upper levels
- Example: neurons → cognitive processes → behavior

**Top-Down Causality:**
- Upper levels influence lower levels
- Example: culture → personality → cognitive processes → neurons

**Interaction:**
- Both types of causality exist simultaneously
- Levels interact bidirectionally

**Literature:**
- **Jeffrey Goldstein, "Emergence in Complex Systems"** (1999, English)
  - On emergent properties

### 3.4. Example: Depression at Different Levels

**Example of Analysis of Depression at Different Levels:**

**1. Neural Level:**
- **Serotonin Deficit:** low serotonin level
- **Structural Changes:** decrease in hippocampus volume
- **Functional Changes:** disruption of prefrontal cortex activity

**2. Cognitive Level:**
- **Negative Cognitive Schemas:** negative thinking about self, world, future
- **Thinking Errors:** catastrophization, black-and-white thinking
- **Attention Disorder:** focus on negative information

**3. Personality Level:**
- **Personality Traits:** neuroticism, low self-esteem
- **Motives:** need for approval, fear of rejection
- **Coping Style:** avoidance, passivity

**4. Social Level:**
- **Social Relationships:** conflicts, isolation
- **Social Support:** absence of support
- **Social Roles:** loss of roles

**5. Cultural Level:**
- **Cultural Factors:** cultural meanings of depression
- **Historical Context:** changes in society
- **Social Institutions:** access to treatment

**Integration of Levels:**

All levels interact:
- **Biology Influences Psychology:** serotonin deficit influences mood
- **Psychology Influences Biology:** stress influences neurotransmitters
- **Society Influences Psychology:** social factors influence cognitions
- **Culture Influences Society:** cultural meanings influence social relationships

Complete understanding of depression requires integration of all levels.

**Literature:**
- **George Engel, "The Need for a New Medical Model"** (1977, English)
  - On biopsychosocial model

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose a psychological event and analyze it at different levels:
   - Neural level
   - Cognitive level
   - Personality level
   - Social level
   - Cultural level
   - How are levels connected?

2. Analyze problem of reduction:
   - Can event be reduced to biology?
   - Are there emergent properties?
   - How to integrate levels?

3. Study example of multi-level analysis:
   - Which levels are used?
   - How are they integrated?
   - What problems are there?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Fodor's work "Special Sciences" — this is a classic work on anti-reductionism. Then study biopsychosocial model (Engel) — it shows how to integrate different levels. Study examples of analysis at different levels (Kandel — neural, Vygotsky — cultural).
