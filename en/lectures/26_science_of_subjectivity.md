# Lecture 26: Discussion: Can We Do Science of Subjectivity?

## 1. Introduction

One of central methodological problems of psychology is problem of subjectivity. Can we do science of subjective experience? How to study what is not directly observable? Three positions give different answers to these questions.

In this lecture, we will examine discussion about possibility of science of subjectivity: Position 1 (yes, but need special methods), Position 2 (no, subjectivity is unscientific), Position 3 (yes, through objective correlates), and questions for discussion.

**Lecture goal:** Understand various positions on question of possibility of science of subjectivity, their arguments, and problems of each position.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Subjectivity in Psychology

**Why is this important?**

Psychology studies subjective experience — experiences, thoughts, feelings. But subjective experience is not directly observable. Can we do science of what is not observable? This is fundamental methodological question.

**The Problem of Subjectivity:**

**Main Problem:**
- Subjective experience is not directly observable
- Science requires objectivity
- How to study subjective scientifically?

**Three Positions:**

1. **Position 1: Yes, but Need Special Methods**
   - Subjectivity can be studied through self-reports, introspection
   - Need qualitative methods, interpretation, hermeneutics

2. **Position 2: No, Subjectivity is Unscientific**
   - Science studies objective, observable
   - Subjectivity is philosophy, not science
   - Psychology should study behavior, not psyche

3. **Position 3: Yes, Through Objective Correlates**
   - Subjectivity is connected to objective processes (brain, behavior)
   - Study not subjectivity directly, but its manifestations
   - Connection of first and third person (neurophenomenology)

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many approaches study subjective
- Different approaches give different answers
- Discussion continues

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different positions give different answers. It is important to understand arguments of each position and their limitations.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Position 1: Yes, but Need Special Methods

**Main Idea:**

Subjectivity can be studied scientifically, but need special methods, different from methods of natural sciences:
- **Self-Reports:** people can report about their experience
- **Introspection:** method of introspection
- **Qualitative Methods:** interviews, phenomenology
- **Interpretation:** hermeneutics, interpretative analysis

**Arguments for Position 1:**

1. **Access to Subjective:**
   - People have access to their experience
   - Can report experiences through self-reports
   - Example: "I feel anxiety" — report about subjective experience

2. **Importance of Subjective:**
   - Subjective experience important for understanding humans
   - Cannot ignore experiences
   - Example: understanding depression requires understanding experiences

3. **Special Methods:**
   - For subjective need special methods
   - Qualitative methods, interpretation
   - Example: phenomenology, hermeneutics

**Approaches in Position 1:**

1. **Phenomenology (Husserl):**
   - Study of phenomena of consciousness as given
   - Phenomenological reduction
   - Example: studying experience of time

2. **Hermeneutics (Gadamer):**
   - Interpretation of meanings, significances
   - Hermeneutic circle
   - Example: interpretation of experiences

3. **Qualitative Methods:**
   - Interviews, observation
   - Focus on understanding, meanings
   - Example: studying experiences through interviews

**Problems of Position 1:**

1. **Problem of Verifiability:**
   - How to verify self-reports?
   - Self-reports may be inaccurate, distorted
   - Example: people may distort their experiences

2. **Problem of Interpretation:**
   - Interpretation is subjective
   - Different interpreters may interpret differently
   - Example: how to verify interpretation?

3. **Problem of Scientificity:**
   - Is this scientific?
   - Can interpretation be considered science?
   - Example: criteria of scientificity

**Literature:**
- **Edmund Husserl, "Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology"** (1913, German, Russian trans. 1999)
  - On phenomenological study of subjectivity
- **Hans-Georg Gadamer, "Truth and Method"** (1960, German, Russian trans. 1988)
  - On hermeneutic study of subjectivity

### 3.2. Position 2: No, Subjectivity is Unscientific

**Main Idea:**

Science studies objective, observable. Subjectivity is not observable, therefore cannot be scientific object:
- **Psychology Should Study Behavior:** observable behavior, not unobservable psyche
- **Ignoring Subjective:** subjective experience — black box, do not study
- **Objective Methods:** only objective methods (experiment, observation)

**Arguments for Position 2:**

1. **Requirement of Objectivity:**
   - Science requires objectivity
   - Subjectivity is not objective
   - Example: cannot objectively verify experiences

2. **Problem of Access:**
   - No access to subjective experience of others
   - Can only observe behavior
   - Example: see behavior, not experiences

3. **Problem of Verification:**
   - Impossible to verify subjective experience
   - No criteria of truth
   - Example: how to verify that person really feels?

**Approaches in Position 2:**

1. **Behaviorism (Watson, Skinner):**
   - Focus on observable behavior
   - Ignoring psyche
   - Example: studying behavior, not experiences

2. **Positivism:**
   - Only observable is real
   - Subjective is metaphysics
   - Example: only behavior, not psyche

**Problems of Position 2:**

1. **Loss of Important:**
   - Ignores subjective experience
   - Loses important part of human
   - Example: does not explain experiences, meanings

2. **Limitation:**
   - Does not explain many phenomena
   - Language, thinking difficult to explain only through behavior
   - Example: cognitive revolution showed limitations

3. **Problem of Completeness:**
   - Incomplete understanding of human
   - Ignoring important aspects
   - Example: experiences important for human

**Literature:**
- **John Watson, "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It"** (1913, English)
  - On behaviorist approach
- **Burrhus Skinner, "The Behavior of Organisms"** (1938, English, Russian trans. 2018)
  - On behaviorism

### 3.3. Position 3: Yes, Through Objective Correlates

**Main Idea:**

Subjectivity is connected to objective processes (brain, behavior). Study not subjectivity directly, but its objective correlates:
- **Neural Correlates:** subjective experience has neural correlates
- **Behavioral Correlates:** subjective experience manifests in behavior
- **Connection of First and Third Person:** connection of subjective experience (first person) and objective data (third person)

**Arguments for Position 3:**

1. **Connection with Objective:**
   - Subjectivity connected to objective processes
   - Brain, behavior are objective correlates of subjectivity
   - Example: fear connected to amygdala activity

2. **Scientific Verification:**
   - Can verify objective correlates
   - Neuroscience, behavioral data
   - Example: neuroimaging of experiences

3. **Integration:**
   - Can integrate subjective and objective
   - Neurophenomenology: connection of first and third person
   - Example: studying consciousness through neurophenomenology

**Approaches in Position 3:**

1. **Cognitive Neuroscience:**
   - Studying neural correlates of cognitive processes
   - Neuroimaging
   - Example: neuroimaging of memory, attention

2. **Neurophenomenology (Varela):**
   - Connection of phenomenology and neuroscience
   - Studying subjective experience through neural correlates
   - Example: studying consciousness

3. **Psychophysiology:**
   - Studying connection between physiological processes and subjective experience
   - Physiological correlates of experiences
   - Example: connection between hormones and emotions

**Problems of Position 3:**

1. **Hard Problem:**
   - How do objective processes create subjective experience?
   - Hard problem of consciousness (Chalmers)
   - Example: how do neurons create experience?

2. **Problem of Correlation:**
   - Correlation does not explain subjectivity
   - How to move from correlation to causation?
   - Example: amygdala activity correlates with fear, but how creates experience?

3. **Problem of Integration:**
   - How to integrate subjective and objective?
   - Different epistemologies (subjectivity vs. objectivity)
   - Example: how to combine phenomenology and neuroscience?

**Literature:**
- **David Chalmers, "The Conscious Mind"** (1996, English, Russian trans. 2013)
  - On hard problem of consciousness
- **Francisco Varela, "Neurophenomenology: Methodological Analysis"** (1996, English)
  - On neurophenomenology
