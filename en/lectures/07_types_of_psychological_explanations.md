# Lecture 7: Types of Psychological Explanations: Causal, Functional, Systemic

## 1. Introduction

Psychology uses different types of explanations to understand events. Why does a person behave this way and not that? One can explain through **cause** (X causes Y), **function** (Y exists to perform function Z), or **system** (Y is part of system S, its properties are determined by its place in the system).

Different types of explanations give different answers and are used in different approaches. Which type of explanation is appropriate when? What are their strengths and weaknesses? These questions are fundamental to psychology methodology.

In this lecture, we will examine three main types of psychological explanations: **causal**, **functional**, and **systemic**. We will analyze their characteristics, examples from psychology, and problems of each type.

**Lecture goal:** Understand differences between types of explanations, their strengths and weaknesses, and when which type is appropriate in psychology.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Types of Explanations

**Why is this important?**

The same phenomenon can be explained differently:
- **Causal explanation:** X causes Y (stimulus → response, neurons → behavior)
- **Functional explanation:** Y exists to perform function Z (evolutionary approach)
- **Systemic explanation:** Y is part of system S, its properties are determined by its place in the system

Different types of explanations give different answers and are used in different approaches. Which type of explanation is appropriate when? This is a fundamental question of methodology.

**The Problem of Type Choice:**

**Causal Explanation:**
- Pros: concreteness, predictability
- Cons: simplification, problem of determinism
- Question: can we always find a cause? Is everything causal?

**Functional Explanation:**
- Pros: explains purpose, evolutionary logic
- Cons: teleology, speculativeness
- Question: does everything really have a function? Can function be tested?

**Systemic Explanation:**
- Pros: considers context, integrity
- Cons: complexity, difficulty of testing
- Question: how to test systemic explanation? Is it too complex?

**The Problem of Compatibility:**

Can different types of explanations be combined? Or are they incompatible?
- Causal explanation focuses on mechanisms
- Functional — on purpose
- Systemic — on context

Can they be integrated? Or must one choose one type?

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, all three types of explanations are used:
- **Causal:** in experimental psychology, neuroscience (stimulus → response, neurons → behavior)
- **Functional:** in evolutionary psychology (behavior exists for survival and reproduction)
- **Systemic:** in cultural-historical approach (behavior depends on activity system)

Which type is appropriate when? Can they be integrated?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand differences between types of explanations and their limitations.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Causal Explanation: X Causes Y

**What is Causal Explanation?**

Causal explanation explains an event through cause: X causes Y. This is explanation through mechanism — what leads to the event.

**Characteristics of Causal Explanation:**

1. **Causality:** explanation through cause and effect
   - X → Y (cause → effect)
   - Example: stimulus → response, neurons → behavior

2. **Mechanism:** explanation through mechanism of action
   - How does X lead to Y?
   - Example: how does stimulus cause response? How do neurons cause behavior?

3. **Determinism:** causality assumes determinism
   - If X, then Y (under certain conditions)
   - Example: if stimulus is presented, response will occur

4. **Temporal Sequence:** cause precedes effect
   - X occurs before Y
   - Example: stimulus precedes response

**Examples of Causal Explanations in Psychology:**

1. **Behaviorism (Watson, Skinner):**
   - **Explanation:** behavior is caused by environmental stimuli
   - **Mechanism:** stimulus → response, reinforcement → behavior reinforcement
   - **Example:** rat presses lever because it is reinforced by food

2. **Neuropsychology:**
   - **Explanation:** behavior is caused by neuron activity
   - **Mechanism:** neurons → neurotransmitters → behavior
   - **Example:** fear is caused by amygdala activity

3. **Cognitive Psychology:**
   - **Explanation:** behavior is caused by cognitive processes
   - **Mechanism:** information → processing → behavior
   - **Example:** problem solving is caused by cognitive processes

**Pros of Causal Explanation:**

1. **Concreteness:** causal explanation is concrete — points to a specific cause

2. **Predictability:** if we know the cause, we can predict the effect

3. **Testability:** causal explanation can be tested experimentally

4. **Mechanism:** explains mechanism of action — how the event occurs

**Cons of Causal Explanation:**

1. **Simplification:** simplifies complexity of events — focuses on one cause

2. **Problem of Determinism:** assumes determinism — is everything causal? Is everything predictable?

3. **Multiple Causes:** many events have multiple causes — how to account for them?

4. **Mutual Causality:** many events are mutually causal — how to account for feedback?

**Problems of Causal Explanation:**

1. **Problem of Causality:**
   - How to determine that X is really the cause of Y?
   - Correlation ≠ Causation
   - Need experiment or other methods to establish causality

2. **Problem of Multiple Causes:**
   - Many events have multiple causes
   - How to account for all causes?
   - How to determine contribution of each cause?

3. **Problem of Context:**
   - Causality depends on context
   - X causes Y under certain conditions
   - How to account for all conditions?

**Literature:**
- **John Stuart Mill, "A System of Logic"** (1843, English)
  - Book III: "On Inference" — on causality and induction
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934, Engl. trans. 2005)
  - Chapter 12: "Explanation" — on causal explanation
- **David Hume, "A Treatise of Human Nature"** (1739, English, Russian trans. 1995)
  - Book I, Part III: on causality

### 3.2. Functional Explanation: Y Exists for Z

**What is Functional Explanation?**

Functional explanation explains an event through its function: Y exists to perform function Z. This is explanation through purpose — why the event exists.

**Characteristics of Functional Explanation:**

1. **Function:** explanation through function of the event
   - Y exists to perform function Z
   - Example: fear exists to protect from danger

2. **Teleology:** explanation through goal or purpose
   - Event exists for something
   - Example: memory exists to store information

3. **Evolutionary Logic:** often linked with evolution
   - Event developed for survival and reproduction
   - Example: fear developed to protect from danger

4. **Adaptiveness:** explanation through adaptiveness
   - Event is adaptive — helps survive
   - Example: memory is adaptive — helps navigate the world

**Examples of Functional Explanations in Psychology:**

1. **Evolutionary Psychology:**
   - **Explanation:** behavior exists for survival and reproduction
   - **Function:** behavior is adaptive — helps survive
   - **Example:** fear exists to protect from danger, love to form pairs

2. **Functionalism (James, Dewey):**
   - **Explanation:** mental processes exist for adaptation
   - **Function:** mind helps adapt to environment
   - **Example:** consciousness exists to control behavior

3. **Ecological Psychology:**
   - **Explanation:** behavior exists for interaction with environment
   - **Function:** behavior is functional in context of environment
   - **Example:** perception exists for spatial orientation

**Pros of Functional Explanation:**

1. **Explains Purpose:** explains why the event exists

2. **Evolutionary Logic:** links events with evolution and adaptation

3. **Integrity:** considers event in context of its purpose

4. **Adaptiveness:** explains adaptive value of events

**Cons of Functional Explanation:**

1. **Teleology:** functional explanation is teleological — assumes goal, which is problematic

2. **Speculativeness:** often speculative — difficult to test function

3. **Problem of Adaptiveness:** not all events are adaptive — what to do with non-adaptive ones?

4. **Just-So Stories:** often becomes "just-so stories" — post hoc explanation

**Problems of Functional Explanation:**

1. **Problem of Teleology:**
   - Functional explanation is teleological — assumes goal
   - But in nature there are no goals — only causes and effects
   - How to avoid teleology?

2. **Problem of Testing:**
   - Difficult to test functional explanation
   - How to test that Y really exists for Z?
   - Often speculative

3. **Problem of Adaptiveness:**
   - Not all events are adaptive
   - What to do with non-adaptive events?
   - How to determine if an event is adaptive?

4. **Problem of "Just-So Stories":**
   - Functional explanation often becomes "just-so story"
   - Post hoc explanation — any event can be explained functionally
   - How to avoid "just-so stories"?

**Literature:**
- **William James, "The Principles of Psychology"** (1890, English)
  - Chapter 1: "Scope of Psychology" — on functionalism
- **David Buss, "Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind"** (2015, English, Russian trans. 2018)

### 3.3. Systemic Explanation: Y is Part of System S

**What is Systemic Explanation?**

Systemic explanation explains an event through system: Y is part of system S, its properties are determined by its place in the system. This is explanation through context — how the event is connected with the system.

**Characteristics of Systemic Explanation:**

1. **System:** explanation through system
   - Y is part of system S
   - Example: behavior is part of activity system

2. **Integrity:** explanation through whole
   - Properties of part are determined by whole
   - Example: properties of behavior are determined by activity system

3. **Context:** explanation through context
   - Event depends on context
   - Example: behavior depends on social context

4. **Interconnections:** explanation through interconnections
   - Event is connected with other elements of system
   - Example: behavior is connected with other elements of activity

**Examples of Systemic Explanations in Psychology:**

1. **Cultural-Historical Approach (Vygotsky, Leontiev):**
   - **Explanation:** behavior is part of activity system
   - **System:** behavior is determined by activity system, cultural tools
   - **Example:** speech is determined by language activity system

2. **Gestalt Psychology:**
   - **Explanation:** behavior is part of gestalt
   - **System:** properties of part are determined by gestalt
   - **Example:** figure perception depends on background

3. **Sociocultural Approach:**
   - **Explanation:** behavior is part of sociocultural system
   - **System:** behavior is determined by sociocultural context
   - **Example:** personality is determined by sociocultural context

**Pros of Systemic Explanation:**

1. **Considers Context:** considers context of event

2. **Integrity:** considers event in context of whole

3. **Interconnections:** considers interconnections of system elements

4. **Complexity:** considers complexity of events

**Cons of Systemic Explanation:**

1. **Complexity:** systemic explanation is complex — difficult to account for all system elements

2. **Difficulty of Testing:** difficult to test systemic explanation — too many variables

3. **Vagueness:** often vague — not concrete

4. **Problem of Reduction:** difficult to determine what is part of system

**Problems of Systemic Explanation:**

1. **Problem of System Boundaries:**
   - Where does system end?
   - What is included in system and what is not?
   - How to determine system boundaries?

2. **Problem of Complexity:**
   - System is too complex — difficult to account for all elements
   - How to simplify system without losing important aspects?

3. **Problem of Testing:**
   - Difficult to test systemic explanation
   - Too many variables, interconnections
   - How to test systemic explanation?

4. **Problem of Specificity:**
   - Systemic explanation often too general
   - Not concrete, vague
   - How to make systemic explanation more concrete?

### 3.4. When is Which Type Appropriate?

**Choice of Explanation Type:**

Different types of explanations are appropriate in different situations:
- **Causal:** when need to understand mechanism, cause
- **Functional:** when need to understand purpose, adaptiveness
- **Systemic:** when need to understand context, interconnections

**Causal Explanation is Appropriate:**

1. **In Experimental Psychology:** when need to test cause-effect connections
2. **In Neuroscience:** when need to understand neural mechanisms
3. **When Event is Simple:** when can isolate one cause

**Example:** Studying influence of reinforcement on behavior — causal explanation (reinforcement causes behavior reinforcement)

**Functional Explanation is Appropriate:**

1. **In Evolutionary Psychology:** when need to understand evolutionary logic
2. **In Ecological Psychology:** when need to understand adaptiveness
3. **When Event is Complex:** when difficult to isolate one cause

**Example:** Studying fear — functional explanation (fear exists to protect from danger)

**Systemic Explanation is Appropriate:**

1. **In Cultural-Historical Approach:** when need to consider sociocultural context
2. **In Gestalt Psychology:** when need to consider integrity
3. **When Event Depends on Context:** when event strongly depends on context

**Example:** Studying speech — systemic explanation (speech is determined by language activity system)

**Integration of Explanation Types:**

Can different types of explanations be integrated? Yes, for complete understanding of event:
- **Causal:** explains mechanism
- **Functional:** explains purpose
- **Systemic:** explains context

**Example:** Studying Fear:
- **Causal:** fear is caused by amygdala activity
- **Functional:** fear exists to protect from danger
- **Systemic:** fear depends on context, culture

**Literature:**
- **John Stuart Mill, "A System of Logic"** (1843, English)
  - Book VI: "On the Methods of Social Sciences" — on choice of explanation type
- **Carl Hempel, "Philosophy of Natural Science"** (1966, English, Russian trans. 1968)
  - Chapter 1: "Scientific Explanation" — on types of explanations

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose a specific psychological event and explain it using three types:
   - Causal explanation: what causes the event?
   - Functional explanation: why does the event exist?
   - Systemic explanation: how is the event connected with the system?

2. Compare three types of explanations:
   - What are their differences?
   - When is which type appropriate?
   - Can they be integrated?

3. Analyze which type of explanation is used in a specific research:
   - Why was this type chosen?
   - What are the limitations of this type?
   - Can other types be used?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading chapter 1 from Hempel's "Philosophy of Natural Science" — this is a classic exposition of types of explanations. Then study examples from psychology — evolutionary psychology (functional), behaviorism (causal), cultural-historical approach (systemic).
