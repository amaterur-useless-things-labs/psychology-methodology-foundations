# Lecture 12: Methodological Pluralism: Why It's Needed and When It Hinders

## 1. Introduction

In psychology, different methods, approaches, paradigms are used simultaneously. This is methodological pluralism — recognition of multiplicity of methods and approaches as normal state of science.

Why is methodological pluralism needed? When does it help and when does it hinder? Is it a plus or minus for psychology? These questions are important for understanding psychology methodology.

In this lecture, we will examine methodological pluralism: its pros and cons, when it is appropriate and when it hinders, and problems it creates for psychology.

**Lecture goal:** Understand role of methodological pluralism in psychology, its pros and cons, and when it is appropriate and when it hinders.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Methodological Pluralism

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, different methods and approaches are used simultaneously:
- Quantitative and qualitative methods
- Experimental and interpretive approaches
- Different paradigms (behaviorism, cognitivism, psychoanalysis)

This is methodological pluralism. But is it a plus or minus?

**The Problem of Multiplicity:**

**Position 1: Pluralism is Strength**
- Different methods give different perspectives
- Completeness of understanding through multiplicity
- Example: quantitative data show "what", qualitative — "why"

**Position 2: Pluralism is Weakness**
- Multiplicity means absence of unified methodology
- Impossibility to compare results of different methods
- Example: how to compare results of experiment and interview?

**The Problem of Compatibility:**

Different methods are based on different paradigms:
- **Positivism:** quantitative methods, objectivity
- **Constructivism:** qualitative methods, interpretation

Can incompatible paradigms be combined? Or is pluralism eclecticism?

**The Problem of Integration:**

How to integrate results of different methods?
- Quantitative data: numerical, statistical
- Qualitative data: textual, interpretive

How to integrate them? Do they contradict each other?

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, pluralism is especially pronounced:
- Many methods, approaches, paradigms
- No single dominant paradigm
- Is this normal or problematic?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand pros and cons of pluralism.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. What is Methodological Pluralism?

**Definition:**

Methodological pluralism is recognition of multiplicity of methods, approaches, paradigms as normal and desirable state of science. Different methods give different perspectives, their multiplicity contributes to completeness of understanding.

**Characteristics of Pluralism:**

1. **Multiplicity of Methods:** use of different research methods
   - Example: experiment, survey, interview, observation

2. **Multiplicity of Approaches:** use of different theoretical approaches
   - Example: behaviorism, cognitivism, psychoanalysis

3. **Multiplicity of Paradigms:** coexistence of different paradigms
   - Example: positivism, constructivism, critical realism

4. **Tolerance:** recognition of legitimacy of different approaches
   - Example: do not reject approaches, but recognize their value

**Pluralism vs. Eclecticism:**

**Pluralism:**
- Conscious use of different methods for different purposes
- Understanding differences and limitations of methods
- Integration of methods based on understanding

**Eclecticism:**
- Random use of different methods without understanding
- Ignoring differences and limitations
- Mechanical combination of methods without integration

**Problem:** How to distinguish pluralism from eclecticism?

**Literature:**
- **Paul Feyerabend, "Against Method"** (1975, Russian trans. 2007)
  - On methodological pluralism and anarchism
- **John Creswell, "Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches"** (2014, English, Russian trans. 2015)
  - On pluralism of methods

### 3.2. Pros of Methodological Pluralism

**1. Different Perspectives:**

Different methods give different perspectives on event:
- **Quantitative Methods:** show "what" (prevalence, connections)
- **Qualitative Methods:** show "why" (meanings, experiences)
- **Combination:** gives complete understanding

**Example:** Studying Depression:
- **Quantitative:** prevalence, risk factors, therapy effectiveness
- **Qualitative:** experiences of depression, meanings, context
- **Combination:** complete understanding of depression

**2. Triangulation (Validation Through Different Methods):**

Different methods can validate each other's results:
- If different methods give consistent results, this increases confidence
- If results diverge, this indicates problems

**Example:** Studying Therapy Effectiveness:
- **Quantitative Data:** improvement on scales
- **Qualitative Data:** description of changes in experiences
- **Consistency:** increases confidence in results

**3. Accounting for Object Complexity:**

Psychological events are complex, multi-level:
- Different methods can study different levels
- Combination of methods gives complete understanding

**Example:** Studying Memory:
- **Neuroscience:** neural mechanisms
- **Cognitive Psychology:** cognitive processes
- **Social Psychology:** social context
- **Combination:** complete understanding of memory

**4. Discovery of New Phenomena:**

Different methods can discover different phenomena:
- **Quantitative Methods:** discover general patterns
- **Qualitative Methods:** discover individual characteristics

**Example:** Studying Stress:
- **Quantitative:** general stress factors
- **Qualitative:** individual stress experiences
- **Combination:** discovers new aspects of stress

**5. Flexibility:**

Pluralism gives flexibility in method choice:
- Can choose method adequate to question
- Not limited to one method

**Literature:**
- **John Creswell, "Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches"** (2014, English, Russian trans. 2015)
  - On pros of mixed methods and pluralism

### 3.3. Cons of Methodological Pluralism

**1. Eclecticism Instead of Integration:**

Pluralism can turn into eclecticism:
- Random use of methods without understanding
- Mechanical combination without integration
- Ignoring differences and limitations

**Example:** Using quantitative and qualitative methods without understanding their differences:
- Collect both
- But do not understand how to integrate them
- Result: eclecticism, not integration

**2. Impossibility to Compare Results:**

Different methods give different types of data:
- **Quantitative:** numerical, statistical
- **Qualitative:** textual, interpretive

How to compare them? How to integrate?

**Example:** Studying Therapy Effectiveness:
- **Quantitative:** 20% improvement on scale
- **Qualitative:** "I feel better"
- How to compare? How to integrate?

**3. Paradigm Conflict:**

Different methods are based on different paradigms:
- **Positivism:** quantitative methods, objectivity
- **Constructivism:** qualitative methods, interpretation

Can incompatible paradigms be combined?

**Example:** Positivism and Constructivism:
- **Positivism:** reality is objective, can be measured
- **Constructivism:** reality is constructed, cannot be measured
- Conflict of ontologies and epistemologies

**4. Appearance of Work Without Real Progress:**

Pluralism can create appearance of work:
- Use many methods
- But do not advance in understanding
- Pluralism as justification for uncertainty

**Example:** Studying Personality:
- Use different methods (tests, interviews, observation)
- But do not integrate results
- Result: much data, but little understanding

**5. Requirement of Expertise:**

Pluralism requires expertise in different methods:
- Need skills in quantitative and qualitative analysis
- Requires more time and resources
- Not all researchers have such expertise

**Literature:**
- **Paul Feyerabend, "Against Method"** (1975, Russian trans. 2007)
  - On problems of methodological pluralism

### 3.4. When Pluralism is Appropriate and When It Hinders

**When Pluralism is Appropriate:**

1. **Studying Complex, Multi-Level Events:**
   - Different methods can study different levels
   - Combination gives complete understanding
   - Example: studying depression (biological, psychological, social levels)

2. **Different Research Questions Require Different Methods:**
   - Some questions require quantitative methods
   - Others require qualitative
   - Example: "How many?" requires quantitative, "Why?" — qualitative

3. **When Need to Understand Event from Different Sides:**
   - Different methods give different perspectives
   - Combination gives complete understanding
   - Example: studying therapy effectiveness (quantitative data show effect, qualitative — how it works)

4. **Validation of Results:**
   - Different methods can validate results
   - Triangulation increases confidence
   - Example: quantitative and qualitative data confirm each other

**When Pluralism Hinders:**

1. **When Methods are Methodologically Incompatible:**
   - Different methods based on incompatible paradigms
   - Impossible to integrate results
   - Example: positivism and constructivism

2. **When Creates Appearance of Work Without Real Progress:**
   - Use many methods
   - But do not advance in understanding
   - Pluralism as justification for uncertainty

3. **When Pluralism is Justification for Uncertainty:**
   - Use pluralism to avoid choice
   - Do not solve methodological problems
   - Example: "use all methods" instead of choosing adequate one

4. **When No Expertise:**
   - Use methods in which incompetent
   - Results unreliable
   - Example: use qualitative methods without understanding their limitations

**Criteria for Appropriateness of Pluralism:**

1. **Understanding Differences:** Understand differences and limitations of methods

2. **Justification:** Justifiably choose methods for specific questions

3. **Integration:** Integrate results of different methods

4. **Expertise:** Have expertise in used methods

**Literature:**
- **John Creswell, "Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches"** (2014, English, Russian trans. 2015)
  - On when to use mixed methods

### 3.5. The Problem of Method Integration

**Main Problem:**

How to integrate results of different methods? Different methods give different types of data:
- **Quantitative:** numerical, statistical
- **Qualitative:** textual, interpretive

How to integrate them?

**Types of Integration:**

1. **Triangulation:**
   - Use of different methods to test results
   - If results are consistent, confidence increases
   - Example: quantitative and qualitative data confirm each other

2. **Complementarity:**
   - Different methods complement each other
   - One method shows "what", another — "why"
   - Example: quantitative data show effect, qualitative — mechanism

3. **Development:**
   - One method develops results of another
   - Example: qualitative data help interpret quantitative

4. **Initiation:**
   - One method initiates questions for another
   - Example: quantitative data show unexpected results, qualitative help understand them

**Problems of Integration:**

1. **Data Incompatibility:**
   - Different types of data difficult to integrate
   - How to integrate numerical and textual data?

2. **Result Conflict:**
   - Different methods may give contradictory results
   - How to resolve conflict?

3. **Priority:**
   - Which method has priority?
   - How to decide when results diverge?

4. **Interpretation:**
   - How to interpret integrated results?
   - Who interprets?

**Literature:**
- **Abbas Tashakkori, Charles Teddlie, "Mixed Methods in Behavioral and Social Sciences"** (2003, English, Russian trans. 2006)
  - On problems of method integration

### Practical Assignments

1. Analyze a specific research using pluralism of methods:
   - Which methods are used?
   - How are they integrated?
   - Is this pluralism or eclecticism?

2. Develop a research plan with pluralism of methods:
   - Which methods to use?
   - How to integrate them?
   - How to avoid eclecticism?

3. Compare pluralism and unified methodology:
   - What are their differences?
   - When is which appropriate?
   - What problems does each approach have?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Feyerabend's work "Against Method" — this is a classic work on methodological pluralism. Then study works on mixed methods (Creswell, Tashakkori and Teddlie) — they show how to integrate different methods.
