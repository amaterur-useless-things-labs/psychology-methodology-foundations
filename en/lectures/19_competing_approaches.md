# Lecture 19: Competing Approaches in Psychology: Behaviorism, Cognitivism, Psychoanalysis, Cultural-Historical Approach

## 1. Introduction

In psychology, there are various competing approaches: behaviorism, cognitivism, psychoanalysis, cultural-historical approach, and others. Each approach has its theoretical foundations, methods, problems. How do they relate to each other? Can they be integrated?

In this lecture, we will examine main competing approaches in psychology: their theoretical foundations, methods, problems, and how they compete with each other.

**Lecture goal:** Understand main competing approaches in psychology, their differences, similarities, and problems of their comparison.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Competing Approaches

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, various competing approaches exist simultaneously:
- Behaviorism, cognitivism, psychoanalysis, cultural-historical approach
- Different ontologies, epistemologies, methods
- Different answers to same questions

How do they relate to each other? Do they compete? Can they be integrated?

**The Problem of Multiplicity:**

**Position 1: Competition**
- Different approaches compete with each other
- One approach can defeat another
- Example: cognitivism replaced behaviorism

**Position 2: Complementarity**
- Different approaches complement each other
- Each approach studies different aspects
- Can use several approaches

**Position 3: Incommensurability**
- Different approaches are incommensurable
- Cannot compare them objectively
- Need to choose based on other criteria

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many competing approaches
- No single dominant paradigm
- Different approaches give different answers to same questions

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand differences in approaches and problems of their comparison.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Behaviorism

**Main Principles:**

1. **Ontology:** behavior is real, psyche is black box
   - Focus on observable behavior
   - Ignoring mental processes

2. **Epistemology:** know through observation, experiment
   - Objective measurement of behavior
   - Ignoring subjective experience

3. **Method:** experiment, observation, measurement of behavior
   - Variable control
   - Statistical analysis

4. **Theory:** behavior determined by stimuli and reinforcement
   - Stimulus → reaction (S-R)
   - Law of Effect (Thorndike)
   - Operant Conditioning (Skinner)

**Examples:**

1. **Classical Conditioning (Pavlov):**
   - Conditioned stimulus → conditioned reaction
   - Example: sound of bell → salivation

2. **Operant Conditioning (Skinner):**
   - Behavior → reinforcement → behavior change
   - Example: pressing lever → food → behavior reinforcement

**Pros:**

1. **Objectivity:** focus on objective behavior
2. **Experimental Rigor:** strict experiments
3. **Practicality:** applicability to therapy, learning

**Cons:**

1. **Ignoring Psyche:** ignoring consciousness, thinking
2. **Mechanistic:** simplification of complexity
3. **Limitation:** does not explain language, thinking

**Crisis of Behaviorism:**

Behaviorism could not explain:
- Language: how can one learn language only through reinforcement?
- Thinking: how can one think without access to psyche?
- Creativity: where does new behavior come from?

Cognitive revolution replaced behaviorism.

**Literature:**
- **B.F. Skinner, "The Behavior of Organisms"** (1938, English, Russian trans. 2018)
  - On behaviorism

### 3.2. Cognitivism

**Main Principles:**

1. **Ontology:** mental processes are real
   - Focus on cognitive processes, structures
   - Analogy with computer (information processing)

2. **Epistemology:** know through modeling processes
   - Modeling cognitive processes
   - Analysis of reaction time, accuracy

3. **Method:** experiment, modeling, neuroimaging
   - Experiments on information processing
   - Modeling cognitive processes
   - Neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG)

4. **Theory:** psyche processes information
   - Perception → processing → memory → thinking
   - Memory models (Atkinson-Shiffrin)
   - Attention models, problem solving

**Examples:**

1. **Atkinson-Shiffrin Memory Model:**
   - Sensory memory → short-term memory → long-term memory

2. **Information Processing Model:**
   - Input → processing → output
   - Encoding → storage → retrieval

**Pros:**

1. **Explanation of Psyche:** explains mental processes
2. **Empirical Support:** has empirical support
3. **Practicality:** applicability to therapy, learning

**Cons:**

1. **Mechanistic:** analogy with computer simplifies
2. **Ignoring Context:** ignoring social, cultural context
3. **Limitation:** does not explain emotions, motivation, personality

**Current Status:**

Cognitivism is dominant paradigm now, but has limitations.

**Literature:**
- **Ulric Neisser, "Cognitive Psychology"** (1967, English, Russian trans. 1981)
  - On cognitivism

### 3.3. Psychoanalysis

**Main Principles:**

1. **Ontology:** unconscious is real, influences behavior
   - Focus on unconscious processes, conflicts
   - Personality structure: Id, Ego, Superego

2. **Epistemology:** know through interpretation of unconscious
   - Interpretation of symptoms, dreams, free associations
   - Analysis of transference, resistance

3. **Method:** interpretation, analysis of transference, free associations
   - Interpretation of unconscious
   - Work with dreams
   - Analysis of defense mechanisms

4. **Theory:** behavior determined by unconscious conflicts
   - Infantile conflicts influence present
   - Defense mechanisms protect from anxiety
   - Development through psychosexual stages

**Examples:**

1. **Interpretation of Symptoms:**
   - Symptom symbolizes unacknowledged conflict
   - Example: avoidance of public speaking — fear of rejection

2. **Defense Mechanisms:**
   - Repression, projection, regression
   - Protection from unconscious anxiety

**Pros:**

1. **Depth:** consideration of unconscious, depth of psyche
2. **Comprehensiveness:** consideration of development, personality history
3. **Therapeutic Effectiveness:** effectiveness in therapy

**Cons:**

1. **Untestability:** difficult to test interpretations
2. **Subjectivity:** interpretation is subjective
3. **Limitation:** does not explain normal behavior, social factors

**Current Status:**

Psychoanalysis is separate research program, not dominant, but influential.

**Literature:**
- **Sigmund Freud, "Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis"** (1917, German, Russian trans. 1989)
  - On psychoanalysis

### 3.4. Cultural-Historical Approach

**Main Principles:**

1. **Ontology:** psyche is product of activity, culture
   - Focus on activity, cultural tools
   - Psyche arises in activity

2. **Epistemology:** know through studying development in context
   - Studying development in cultural, historical context
   - Analysis of use of cultural tools

3. **Method:** observation of development, analysis of activity, developmental experiment
   - Studying development in natural conditions
   - Analysis of use of cultural tools
   - Formative experiment

4. **Theory:** psyche develops through internalization of activity
   - Higher mental functions arise in activity
   - Cultural tools (language, signs) mediate psyche
   - Development through zone of proximal development

**Examples:**

1. **Development of Speech:**
   - Speech arises in communication, then internalized
   - External speech → internal speech → thinking

2. **Use of Cultural Tools:**
   - Language mediates thinking
   - Signs, symbols mediate memory, attention

**Pros:**

1. **Contextuality:** consideration of cultural, historical context
2. **Development:** focus on development, becoming
3. **Sociality:** consideration of social factors

**Cons:**

1. **Limited Empirical Support:** less empirical data
2. **Complexity:** difficult to apply in practice
3. **Limitation:** does not explain biological factors

**Current Status:**

Cultural-historical approach is separate research program, influential in some areas.

**Literature:**
- **Lev Vygotsky, "History of the Development of Higher Mental Functions"** (1931, Russian)
  - On cultural-historical approach

### 3.5. Comparison of Approaches

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose psychological event and analyze it from four positions:
   - Behaviorism
   - Cognitivism
   - Psychoanalysis
   - Cultural-Historical Approach
   - Compare interpretations

2. Analyze problem of incommensurability:
   - Can approaches be compared objectively?
   - On what criteria to base choice?
   - Can approaches be integrated?

3. Study history of development of approaches:
   - How did approaches develop?
   - Is there progress?
   - Or do approaches just change?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading classical works of each approach (Skinner — behaviorism, Neisser — cognitivism, Freud — psychoanalysis, Vygotsky — cultural-historical). Then consider attempts at comparison and integration (Gholson, Palermo) — they show problems of comparing approaches.
