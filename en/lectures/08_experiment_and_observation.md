# Lecture 8: The Role of Experiment and Observation: Pros and Limitations

## 1. Introduction

Experiment and observation are two main methods of obtaining data in psychology. Experiment allows controlling variables and establishing causality. Observation allows studying natural behavior in real context.

Each method has its pros and limitations. When to use experiment and when observation? How do they complement each other? These questions are fundamental to psychology methodology.

In this lecture, we will examine the role of experiment and observation in psychology, their pros and limitations, and when which method is appropriate.

**Lecture goal:** Understand differences between experiment and observation, their pros and limitations, and when to use which method.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Method Choice

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, different methods of obtaining data are used:
- **Experiment:** controlled research, manipulation of variables
- **Observation:** studying natural behavior without intervention

Each method has its pros and limitations. Which method to use when? This is a fundamental question of methodology.

**The Problem of Control:**

**Experiment:**
- Pros: variable control, establishing causality
- Cons: artificial conditions, ethical limitations

**Observation:**
- Pros: naturalness, ecological validity
- Cons: lack of control, problem of interpretation

**The Problem of Causality:**

**Experiment:**
- Allows establishing causality through variable manipulation
- But not always possible to experiment

**Observation:**
- Allows studying natural behavior
- But does not allow establishing causality

**The Problem of Validity:**

**Experiment:**
- Internal validity: variable control
- External validity: applicability to real life

**Observation:**
- Ecological validity: naturalness of conditions
- Internal validity: difficult to control variables

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many phenomena are difficult to study experimentally (ethical limitations)
- Observation does not allow establishing causality
- How to combine control and naturalness?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand pros and limitations of each method.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Experiment: Control and Causality

**What is an Experiment?**

An experiment is controlled research in which the researcher manipulates an independent variable and measures a dependent variable, controlling other variables.

**Characteristics of Experiment:**

1. **Manipulation:** researcher manipulates independent variable
   - Example: presenting different stimuli, creating different conditions

2. **Control:** researcher controls other variables
   - Example: random assignment of participants, condition control

3. **Measurement:** researcher measures dependent variable
   - Example: reaction time, number of correct answers

4. **Comparison:** researcher compares different conditions
   - Example: experimental group vs. control group

**Types of Experiments:**

1. **Laboratory Experiment:**
   - Conducted in controlled laboratory conditions
   - Pros: high control, reproducibility
   - Cons: artificiality, low ecological validity

2. **Field Experiment:**
   - Conducted in natural conditions
   - Pros: more natural conditions, ecological validity
   - Cons: less control, harder to reproduce

3. **Quasi-Experiment:**
   - Similar to experiment, but without random assignment
   - Pros: can be used when random assignment is impossible
   - Cons: less control, harder to establish causality

**Pros of Experiment:**

1. **Variable Control:** allows controlling other variables, isolating effect of independent variable

2. **Establishing Causality:** allows establishing cause-effect connections through manipulation

3. **Reproducibility:** can reproduce conditions, verify results

4. **Predictability:** if we know the cause, we can predict the effect

**Limitations of Experiment:**

1. **Artificiality of Conditions:** laboratory conditions may be artificial, not corresponding to real life

2. **Ethical Limitations:** cannot experiment with some phenomena (trauma, harm)

3. **Experimenter Effect:** experimenter may inadvertently influence results

4. **Subject Effect:** subjects may react to experimenter expectations (Hawthorne effect)

5. **Limited Ecological Validity:** results may not apply to real life

**Examples of Experiments in Psychology:**

1. **Milgram Experiment (Obedience to Authority, 1963):**
   - **Manipulation:** level of experimenter authority
   - **Measurement:** willingness to administer shocks
   - **Result:** 65% of participants continued to the end
   - **Problem:** ethical questions

2. **Asch Experiment (Conformity, 1951):**
   - **Manipulation:** group answers (correct/incorrect)
   - **Measurement:** agreement with group
   - **Result:** people agreed with group's incorrect answers
   - **Problem:** artificiality of conditions

3. **Stroop Experiment (Interference, 1935):**
   - **Manipulation:** word color (matches/does not match meaning)
   - **Measurement:** reaction time
   - **Result:** slower when color does not match meaning
   - **Plus:** well-controlled experiment

**Literature:**
- **Donald Campbell, Julian Stanley, "Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research"** (1963, English, Russian trans. 1980)
  - Classic work on experiment design
- **Robert Rosenthal, Ralph Rosnow, "Artifacts in Behavioral Research"** (1969, English)
  - On problems of experiments (experimenter effect, subject effect)

### 3.2. Observation: Naturalness and Context

**What is Observation?**

Observation is studying behavior in natural conditions without researcher intervention. Researcher observes and records behavior without manipulating variables.

**Characteristics of Observation:**

1. **Naturalness:** behavior is studied in natural conditions
   - Example: observing children at school, adults at work

2. **Absence of Intervention:** researcher does not intervene in behavior
   - Example: passive observation, behavior recording

3. **Context:** behavior is studied in context
   - Example: considering social, cultural context

4. **Description:** focus on describing behavior, not explaining
   - Example: what happens, not why

**Types of Observation:**

1. **Participant Observation:**
   - Researcher participates in situation
   - Pros: deeper understanding, access to information
   - Cons: influence on situation, subjectivity

2. **Non-Participant Observation:**
   - Researcher does not participate, only observes
   - Pros: less influence, more objective
   - Cons: less access to information

3. **Structured Observation:**
   - Uses predetermined observation scheme
   - Pros: systematicity, comparability
   - Cons: may miss unexpected

4. **Unstructured Observation:**
   - Open observation without predetermined scheme
   - Pros: flexibility, openness to unexpected
   - Cons: subjectivity, difficulty of comparison

**Pros of Observation:**

1. **Naturalness:** behavior is studied in natural conditions, which increases ecological validity

2. **Ecological Validity:** results are applicable to real life

3. **Discovery of New Phenomena:** observation can discover unexpected phenomena

4. **Context:** considering social, cultural context of behavior

5. **Ethical Advantages:** does not require intervention, fewer ethical problems

**Limitations of Observation:**

1. **Lack of Control:** cannot control variables, difficult to establish causality

2. **Problem of Interpretation:** difficult to interpret behavior, may be subjective

3. **Subjectivity:** observation depends on observer, their biases

4. **Problem of Representativeness:** difficult to generalize results to other situations

5. **Observer Effect:** knowledge of observation may influence behavior

**Examples of Observation in Psychology:**

1. **Observation of Children (Piaget):**
   - **Method:** observing children's development in natural conditions
   - **Result:** discovery of cognitive development stages
   - **Plus:** naturalness, considering context

2. **Primate Observation (Goodall):**
   - **Method:** long-term observation of chimpanzees in natural environment
   - **Result:** discovery of complex social behavior
   - **Plus:** discovery of new phenomena

3. **Ethnographic Observation:**
   - **Method:** participant observation in different cultures
   - **Result:** understanding of cultural differences
   - **Plus:** considering cultural context

**Literature:**
- **Jean Piaget, "The Origin of Intelligence in Children"** (1936, English, Russian trans. 1963)
  - On observation method in studying development
- **Jane Goodall, "In the Shadow of Man"** (1971, English, Russian trans. 1974)
  - On observation method in studying primates
