# Lecture 22: Specificity of Psychology's Object: Does Human Specificity Prevent Psychology from Being a Science?

## 1. Introduction

Psychology studies humans — active, reflective, changeable, subjective. This specificity creates unique methodological problems that other sciences do not have. Does human specificity prevent psychology from being a science? Or is this normal specificity that requires special methods?

In this lecture, we will examine features of humans as object of study: activity, reflection, changeability, subjectivity, ethical limitations, and problems they create (experimenter effect, participant effect, representativeness).

**Lecture goal:** Understand specificity of humans as object of study, problems it creates, and how these problems are solved in psychology.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Object Specificity

**Why is this important?**

Humans as object of study are unique:
- **Activity:** humans influence research process
- **Reflection:** humans are aware that they are being studied
- **Changeability:** humans change over time and in different contexts
- **Subjectivity:** internal experience is not directly observable
- **Ethical Limitations:** cannot experiment as with objects of nature

Does this create problems for scientificity of psychology? Or is this normal specificity that requires special methods?

**The Problem of Scientificity:**

**Position 1: Specificity Prevents Scientificity**
- Human specificity makes psychology unscientific
- No objectivity, reproducibility
- Example: criticism of psychology as unscientific

**Position 2: Specificity Requires Special Methods**
- Specificity is normal, requires special methods
- Can be scientific with consideration of specificity
- Example: various methodologies in psychology

**Position 3: Specificity is Strength**
- Specificity gives unique opportunities
- Reflection, subjectivity are resources, not problems
- Example: qualitative methods, phenomenology

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Specificity creates methodological problems
- Different approaches solve them differently
- Discussion about scientificity of psychology continues

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand specificity and problems it creates.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Activity of Object

**What is Activity?**

Humans are not passive objects of study, but active subjects:
- Humans influence research process
- Humans can resist, cooperate, manipulate
- Behavior depends on attitude toward research

**Manifestations of Activity:**

1. **Influence on Process:**
   - Humans can influence course of research
   - Example: refusal to participate, behavior change

2. **Resistance:**
   - Humans can resist research
   - Example: defense mechanisms, resistance to interpretation

3. **Cooperation:**
   - Humans can actively cooperate
   - Example: motivation, interest

**Problems of Activity:**

1. **Problem of Control:**
   - Difficult to control human activity
   - Example: cannot force humans to behave certain way

2. **Problem of Predictability:**
   - Behavior less predictable due to activity
   - Example: unexpected reactions

3. **Problem of Reproducibility:**
   - Activity makes reproduction harder
   - Example: different reactions in different situations

**Solutions:**

1. **Accounting for Activity:**
   - Account for activity as normal feature
   - Example: studying activity as object

2. **Managing Activity:**
   - Manage activity through instructions, motivation
   - Example: clear instructions, motivation to participate

3. **Integrating Activity:**
   - Integrate activity into research
   - Example: collaborative research, participatory research

**Literature:**
- **Donald Campbell, Julian Stanley, "Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research"** (1963, English, Russian trans. 1980)
  - On problems of experiment with active object

### 3.2. Reflection of Object

**What is Reflection?**

Humans are aware that they are being studied, and this influences behavior:
- **Observer Effect:** behavior changes when humans know they are being observed
- **Social Desirability:** humans want to look good
- **Hawthorne Effect:** improvement in performance simply due to attention

**Manifestations of Reflection:**

1. **Hawthorne Effect:**
   - Behavior change due to knowledge of observation
   - Example: improvement in performance under attention

2. **Social Desirability:**
   - Desire to look good before researcher
   - Example: giving socially desirable answers in surveys

3. **Expectation Effect:**
   - Behavior changes under influence of researcher's expectations
   - Example: Pygmalion effect (Rosenthal)

**Problems of Reflection:**

1. **Problem of Objectivity:**
   - Reflection violates objectivity
   - Example: behavior is not "natural"

2. **Problem of Validity:**
   - Reflection influences validity of results
   - Example: results do not reflect "real" behavior

3. **Problem of Control:**
   - Difficult to control reflection
   - Example: cannot hide fact of research

**Solutions:**

1. **Covert Observation:**
   - Observation without participants' knowledge
   - Problem: ethical limitations

2. **Natural Conditions:**
   - Study in natural conditions
   - Example: field experiments

3. **Accounting for Reflection:**
   - Account for reflection as normal feature
   - Example: studying reflection as object

4. **Minimization:**
   - Minimize influence of reflection
   - Example: debriefing, reducing visibility of observation

**Literature:**
- **Robert Rosenthal, Ralph Rosnow, "Artifact in Behavioral Research"** (1969, English)
  - On effect of experimenter expectations

### 3.3. Changeability of Object

**What is Changeability?**

Humans change over time and in different contexts:
- **Temporal Changeability:** humans change over time
- **Contextual Changeability:** behavior depends on context
- **Individual Changeability:** humans differ from each other

**Manifestations of Changeability:**

1. **Temporal Changeability:**
   - Humans change over time
   - Example: development, learning, aging

2. **Contextual Changeability:**
   - Behavior depends on context
   - Example: different behaviors in different situations

3. **Individual Changeability:**
   - Humans differ from each other
   - Example: individual differences

**Problems of Changeability:**

1. **Problem of Generalization:**
   - Difficult to generalize to other humans, situations, times
   - Example: results applicable only in specific context

2. **Problem of Stability:**
   - Difficult to find stable patterns
   - Example: patterns are contextual

3. **Problem of Prediction:**
   - Difficult to predict behavior due to changeability
   - Example: unexpected changes

**Solutions:**

1. **Accounting for Changeability:**
   - Account for changeability as normal feature
   - Example: studying changes, context

2. **Longitudinal Studies:**
   - Studying changes over time
   - Example: longitudinal studies of development

3. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - Accounting for context in analysis
   - Example: studying behavior in context

4. **Individual Approach:**
   - Studying individual differences
   - Example: idiographic approach

- **Gordon Allport, "Personality: A Psychological Interpretation"** (1937, English, Russian trans. 2002)
  - On individual differences

### 3.4. Subjectivity of Object

**What is Subjectivity?**

Internal experience of humans is not directly observable:
- **Non-Observability:** cannot directly observe experiences, thoughts
- **Subjectivity:** experience is subjective, depends on person
- **Problem of Access:** difficult to gain access to subjective experience

**Manifestations of Subjectivity:**

1. **Non-Observability of Internal Experience:**
   - Cannot directly observe thoughts, experiences
   - Example: cannot see what person is thinking

2. **Subjectivity of Experiences:**
   - Experiences are subjective, individual
   - Example: different people experience differently

3. **Problem of Access:**
   - Difficult to gain access to subjective experience
   - Example: self-reports may be inaccurate

**Problems of Subjectivity:**

1. **Problem of Objectivity:**
   - Subjectivity contradicts objectivity
   - Example: how to objectively study subjective?

2. **Problem of Verification:**
   - Difficult to verify subjective experience
   - Example: cannot verify self-reports

3. **Problem of Interpretation:**
   - Subjective experience requires interpretation
   - Example: interpretation depends on interpreter

**Solutions:**

1. **Self-Reports:**
   - Using self-reports for access to subjective
   - Problem: inaccuracy, distortion

2. **Introspection:**
   - Method of introspection
   - Problem: subjectivity, unreliability

3. **Indirect Indicators:**
   - Using indirect indicators
   - Example: behavior, physiology as indicators

4. **Interpretive Methods:**

   - Example: phenomenology, hermeneutics

**Literature:**
- **David Chalmers, "The Conscious Mind"** (1996, English, Russian trans. 2013)
  - On problem of consciousness and subjectivity

### 3.5. Ethical Limitations

**What are Ethical Limitations?**

Cannot experiment with humans as with objects of nature:

- **Informed Consent:** participants must consent
- **Minimizing Harm:** minimizing risks, harm

**Manifestations of Ethical Limitations:**

1. **Protection of Participants:**
   - Protection of rights, dignity of participants
   - Example: confidentiality, safety

2. **Informed Consent:**
   - Participants must give consent
   - Example: understanding risks, research goals

3. **Minimizing Harm:**

### 3.6. Does Specificity Prevent Science?

**Position 1: Specificity Prevents Scientificity**

**Arguments:**
- No objectivity (subjectivity, reflection)
- No reproducibility (changeability, activity)
- Ethical limitations prevent experimentation
- Psychology cannot be science like physics

**Problems:**
- But psychology is still science
- There is objectivity, though limited
- There is reproducibility, though limited

**Position 2: Specificity Requires Special Methods**

**Arguments:**
- Specificity is normal, requires special methods
- Can be scientific with consideration of specificity
- Different objects require different methods
- Psychology is science, but specific

**Problems:**
- What criteria of scientificity to apply?
- How to ensure scientificity with specificity?

**Position 3: Specificity is Strength**

**Arguments:**
- Specificity gives unique opportunities
- Reflection, subjectivity are resources, not problems
- Qualitative methods use specificity
- Psychology uses specificity for understanding

**Problems:**
- But still need scientificity
- How to use specificity scientifically?

**Conclusion:**

Specificity does not prevent psychology from being science, but requires:
- Special methods
- Understanding of limitations
- Critical approach
- Development of methodology

**Literature:**
