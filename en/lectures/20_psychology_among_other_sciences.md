# Lecture 20: Psychology Among Other Sciences: Interdisciplinarity and Boundaries

## 1. Introduction

Psychology is at the intersection of natural and social sciences. It is connected with biology, sociology, philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence. Where does psychology end and other sciences begin? How does psychology interact with other disciplines?

In this lecture, we will examine psychology's place among other sciences: relationships with biology (problem of reduction), sociology (individual vs. social), philosophy (discipline boundaries), and interdisciplinary areas (cognitive science, neuroscience, psycholinguistics).

**Lecture goal:** Understand psychology's place among other sciences, problems of discipline boundaries, and role of interdisciplinarity.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Discipline Boundaries

**Why is this important?**

Psychology is at the intersection of various sciences:
- **Natural Sciences:** biology, neuroscience, physics
- **Social Sciences:** sociology, anthropology, economics
- **Humanities:** philosophy, linguistics, history

Where does psychology end and other sciences begin? How to define discipline boundaries?

**The Problem of Boundaries:**

**Position 1: Clear Boundaries**
- Each science has clear boundaries
- Psychology studies psyche, biology studies organism, sociology studies society
- But boundaries are blurred

**Position 2: Blurred Boundaries**
- Boundaries between sciences are blurred
- There are areas of intersection
- Interdisciplinarity is normal

**Position 3: No Boundaries**
- Boundaries are artificial
- Science is unified, division is conditional
- Interdisciplinarity is necessary

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Psychology is connected with many sciences
- Boundaries are blurred
- Interdisciplinarity is widely spread

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand psychology's place among other sciences and problems of boundaries.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Psychology and Biology: The Problem of Reduction

**Main Problem:**

Can psychology be reduced to biology? Is psyche brain activity?

**Positions:**

1. **Reductionism:**
   - Psyche = brain activity
   - Psychology can be reduced to biology
   - Example: neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience

2. **Anti-Reductionism:**
   - Psyche cannot be reduced to biology
   - There are emergent properties
   - Example: cultural-historical approach

3. **Complementarianism:**
   - Biology and psychology complement each other
   - Both levels needed for complete understanding
   - Example: biopsychosocial model

**Areas of Intersection:**

1. **Neuropsychology:**
   - Studying connection between brain and behavior
   - Example: studying influence of brain damage on behavior

2. **Cognitive Neuroscience:**
   - Studying neural mechanisms of cognitive processes
   - Example: neuroimaging of memory, attention processes

3. **Psychophysiology:**
   - Studying connection between physiological processes and psyche
   - Example: studying connection between stress and hormones

**The Problem of Reduction:**

Can psychology be reduced to biology?
- **For:** successes of neuroscience show that psyche = brain activity
- **Against:** emergent properties, multiple realizability, contextuality

**Literature:**
- **John Bickle, "Philosophy of Science and Neuroscience"** (2009, English)
  - On problem of reduction in neuroscience

### 3.2. Psychology and Sociology: Individual vs. Social

**Main Problem:**

Where does psychology (individual) end and sociology (social) begin?

**Positions:**

1. **Individualism:**
   - Psychology studies individual
   - Sociology studies society
   - Clear division

2. **Social Constructivism:**
   - Individual is constructed socially
   - No clear division
   - Example: social psychology

3. **Interaction:**
   - Individual and social interact
   - Both levels needed
   - Example: social psychology, cultural psychology

**Areas of Intersection:**

1. **Social Psychology:**
   - Studying influence of social factors on behavior
   - Example: conformity, obedience, group processes

2. **Cultural Psychology:**
   - Studying influence of culture on psyche
   - Example: cultural differences in thinking, emotions

3. **Sociology of Personality:**
   - Studying personality in social context
   - Example: influence of social roles on personality

**The Problem of Boundaries:**

Where does psychology end and sociology begin?
- **Psychology:** focus on individual
- **Sociology:** focus on society
- **Social Psychology:** intersection

**Literature:**
- **Kurt Lewin, "Field Theory in Social Science"** (1951, English, Russian trans. 2000)
  - On connection between psychology and sociology

### 3.3. Psychology and Philosophy: Discipline Boundaries

**Main Problem:**

Where does psychology (empirical science) end and philosophy (conceptual analysis) begin?

**Positions:**

1. **Division:**
   - Psychology is empirical science
   - Philosophy is conceptual analysis
   - Clear division

2. **Intersection:**
   - Psychology and philosophy intersect
   - Philosophy asks questions, psychology answers
   - Example: philosophy of mind, philosophy of psychology

3. **Inseparability:**
   - Psychology and philosophy are inseparable
   - Psychology assumes philosophical premises
   - Example: epistemology, ontology

**Areas of Intersection:**

1. **Philosophy of Mind:**
   - Problem of consciousness, mental states
   - Example: hard problem of consciousness (Chalmers)

2. **Philosophy of Psychology:**
   - Methodological, epistemological questions of psychology
   - Example: problem of interpretation, reduction

3. **Epistemology:**
   - Problem of knowledge, cognition
   - Example: how do we know? What is knowledge?

**The Problem of Boundaries:**

Where does psychology end and philosophy begin?
- **Psychology:** empirical study of psyche
- **Philosophy:** conceptual analysis
- **Intersection:** philosophy asks questions, psychology answers

**Literature:**
- **David Chalmers, "The Conscious Mind"** (1996, English, Russian trans. 2013)
  - On problem of consciousness

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose interdisciplinary area and analyze:
   - Which disciplines intersect?
   - Where are boundaries?
   - How are they integrated?

2. Analyze problem of reduction:
   - Can psychology be reduced to biology?
   - Are there emergent properties?
   - How to integrate levels?

3. Study specific interdisciplinary research:
   - Which disciplines are used?
   - How are they integrated?
   - What problems are there?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Bickle's work "Philosophy of Science and Neuroscience" — this is a good introduction to problem of reduction. Then study interdisciplinary areas (cognitive science, neuroscience) — they show how disciplines intersect.
