# Lecture 10: Correlation vs. Causation — Battle of the Century

## 1. Introduction

One of the most common methodological errors in psychology is confusion between correlation and causation. Correlation means two variables are related. Causation means one variable causes another.

Correlation ≠ Causation. This fundamental difference is critical for understanding psychological research. How to distinguish correlation from causation? How to establish causation? These questions are important for psychology methodology.

In this lecture, we will examine differences between correlation and causation, problems of establishing causation, criteria of causation, and how to avoid errors in interpreting correlations.

**Lecture goal:** Understand differences between correlation and causation, criteria for establishing causation, and how to correctly interpret correlational research.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Correlation and Causation

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, many studies are correlational — they show a connection between variables, but not causation. However, researchers and media often interpret correlations as causation, which leads to erroneous conclusions.

**The Problem of Difference:**

**Correlation:**
- Two variables are related (change together)
- Example: high intelligence correlates with academic success
- Question: does intelligence cause success? Or does success cause intelligence? Or is there a third variable?

**Causation:**
- One variable causes another
- Example: learning causes improvement in results
- Question: how to establish causation? How to distinguish from correlation?

**The Problem of Establishing Causation:**

Correlation does not prove causation. Alternative explanations are possible:
1. **Third Variable:** both variables caused by a third variable
2. **Reverse Causation:** Y causes X, not X causes Y
3. **Coincidence:** connection is random, not causal

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Many studies are correlational (surveys, observations)
- Experiments are not always possible (ethical limitations)
- How to establish causation without experiment?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different methods give different possibilities for establishing causation. It is important to understand differences and limitations.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Correlation: Connection Between Variables

**What is Correlation?**

Correlation is a statistical measure of connection between two variables. It shows how much variables change together.

**Characteristics of Correlation:**

1. **Direction:** positive or negative
   - **Positive:** both variables change in the same direction (more X → more Y)
   - **Negative:** variables change in opposite directions (more X → less Y)

2. **Strength:** from -1 to +1
   - **+1:** perfect positive connection
   - **0:** no connection
   - **-1:** perfect negative connection

3. **Significance:** statistical significance of connection
   - p < 0.05: connection is statistically significant
   - But significance does not mean causation!

**Examples of Correlations in Psychology:**

1. **Intelligence and Academic Success:**
   - **Correlation:** r = 0.5-0.6 (moderate positive connection)
   - **Interpretation:** people with high intelligence study better
   - **Question:** does intelligence cause success? Or the opposite? Or is there a third variable?

2. **Anxiety and Depression:**
   - **Correlation:** r = 0.6-0.7 (strong positive connection)
   - **Interpretation:** people with anxiety more often have depression
   - **Question:** does anxiety cause depression? Or the opposite? Or both caused by a third variable?

3. **TV Viewing and Aggression:**
   - **Correlation:** r = 0.3-0.4 (moderate positive connection)
   - **Interpretation:** people who watch a lot of TV are more aggressive
   - **Question:** does TV cause aggression? Or do aggressive people watch more TV?

**The Problem of Interpreting Correlations:**

Correlation does not prove causation. Three alternative explanations are possible:

1. **X Causes Y:** causation in one direction
   - Example: learning → success

2. **Y Causes X:** reverse causation
   - Example: success → confidence → better results

3. **Z Causes X and Y:** third variable
   - Example: socioeconomic status → intelligence and success

4. **Coincidence:** connection is random, not causal
   - Example: ice cream consumption and drownings

**Literature:**
- **David Moore, George McCabe, "Introduction to the Practice of Statistics"** (2016, English, Russian trans. 2018)
  - Chapter 4: "Correlation and Regression" — on correlation
- **Andy Field, "Discovering Statistics Using SPSS"** (2018, English, Russian trans. 2020)
  - Chapter 6: "Correlation" — on correlation and its interpretation

### 3.2. Causation: X Causes Y

**What is Causation?**

Causation is a relation in which one variable (cause) causes changes in another variable (effect). X → Y (X causes Y).

**Characteristics of Causation:**

1. **Temporal Sequence:** cause precedes effect
   - X occurs before Y
   - But precedence does not prove causation!

2. **Connection:** change in X is connected with change in Y
   - When X changes, Y changes
   - But connection does not prove causation!

3. **Exclusion of Alternatives:** no alternative explanations
   - No third variable
   - No reverse causation
   - No coincidence

**How to Establish Causation?**

**Experiment — Gold Standard:**

Experiment allows establishing causation through:
1. **Manipulation:** researcher manipulates independent variable
2. **Control:** controls other variables
3. **Random Assignment:** randomly assigns participants
4. **Comparison:** compares experimental and control groups

**Example:** Influence of Reinforcement on Behavior:
- **Manipulation:** reinforcement (yes/no)
- **Control:** other variables (same conditions)
- **Result:** reinforcement causes behavior reinforcement
- **Conclusion:** causation established

**Hill's Criteria (1965):**

When experiment is impossible, Hill's criteria can be used to evaluate causation:

1. **Temporal Sequence:** cause precedes effect
   - X occurs before Y
   - Example: smoking precedes lung cancer

2. **Strength of Connection:** strong connection more likely causal
   - Strong correlation more likely causal
   - Example: strong connection between smoking and lung cancer

3. **Specificity:** cause is specific to effect
   - X specifically causes Y
   - Example: smoking specifically connected with lung cancer

4. **Dose-Effect:** more cause → more effect
   - More X → more Y
   - Example: more smoking → more cancer risk

5. **Reversibility:** removing cause removes effect
   - Without X → no Y
   - Example: stopping smoking reduces cancer risk

6. **Consistency:** connection reproduced in different studies
   - Results consistent across different studies
   - Example: connection between smoking and cancer reproduced

**Limitations of Hill's Criteria:**

1. **Necessity but Not Sufficiency:** criteria help evaluate causation, but do not prove it

2. **Not All Criteria Applicable:** not all criteria applicable to all events

3. **Interpretation:** criteria require interpretation, may be subjective

**Literature:**
- **Austin Bradford Hill, "The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?"** (1965, English)
  - Classic work on criteria of causation
- **Donald Campbell, Julian Stanley, "Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs"** (1963, English, Russian trans. 1980)
  - On methods of establishing causation

### 3.3. The Problem of Third Variable

**What is Third Variable?**

Third variable is a variable that causes both X and Y, creating illusion of causation between X and Y. Z → X and Z → Y, but not X → Y.

**Examples of Third Variable:**

1. **Ice Cream Consumption and Drownings:**
   - **Correlation:** ice cream consumption correlates with drownings
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** ice cream causes drownings
   - **Third Variable:** temperature (heat → more ice cream and more swimming → more drownings)

2. **Intelligence and Academic Success:**
   - **Correlation:** intelligence correlates with academic success
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** intelligence causes success
   - **Third Variable:** socioeconomic status (SES → access to education and better development conditions → intelligence and success)

3. **Height and Income:**
   - **Correlation:** tall people earn more
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** height causes income
   - **Third Variable:** gender, nutrition, health (multiple factors)

**How to Account for Third Variable?**

1. **Variable Control:**
   - Control third variable in research
   - Example: control SES when studying connection between intelligence and success

2. **Statistical Control:**
   - Control third variable statistically (regression, ANCOVA)
   - Example: statistically control SES

3. **Experiment:**
   - Experiment controls third variable through random assignment
   - Example: random assignment of participants controls all variables

**The Problem of Multiple Third Variables:**

In reality, there can be many third variables:
- Difficult to account for all third variables
- Which third variables are important?
- How to account for all of them?

**Literature:**
- **David Kenny, "Correlation and Causality"** (1979, English)
  - On the problem of third variable

### 3.4. The Problem of Reverse Causation

**What is Reverse Causation?**

Reverse causation is a situation where Y causes X, not X causes Y. Correlation can be explained by reverse causation.

**Examples of Reverse Causation:**

1. **Depression and Low Activity:**
   - **Correlation:** depression correlates with low activity
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** low activity causes depression
   - **Reverse Causation:** depression causes low activity

2. **TV Viewing and Aggression:**
   - **Correlation:** TV viewing correlates with aggression
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** TV causes aggression
   - **Reverse Causation:** aggressive people watch more TV

3. **Confidence and Success:**
   - **Correlation:** confidence correlates with success
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** confidence causes success
   - **Reverse Causation:** success causes confidence

**How to Distinguish Direction of Causation?**

1. **Temporal Sequence:**
   - If X occurs before Y, then X → Y (but not vice versa)
   - Example: learning precedes success → learning → success

2. **Longitudinal Study:**
   - Studying changes over time
   - Example: studying changes in confidence and success over time

3. **Experiment:**
   - Experiment establishes direction through manipulation
   - Example: manipulation of learning → change in success

**The Problem of Mutual Causation:**

Many events are mutually causal:
- X → Y and Y → X (mutual causation)
- Example: confidence → success → confidence
- How to account for mutual causation?

**Literature:**
- **David Kenny, "Correlation and Causality"** (1979, English)
  - On the problem of reverse causation

### 3.5. Examples of Spurious Correlations

**Classic Examples:**

1. **Ice Cream Consumption and Drownings:**
   - **Correlation:** r = 0.8 (strong connection)
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** ice cream causes drownings
   - **Third Variable:** temperature (heat)

2. **Number of Churches and Crime:**
   - **Correlation:** more churches → more crime
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** churches cause crime
   - **Third Variable:** city size (large city → more churches and more crime)

3. **Chocolate Consumption and Nobel Prizes:**
   - **Correlation:** chocolate consumption correlates with number of Nobel Prizes
   - **Erroneous Conclusion:** chocolate increases intelligence
   - **Third Variable:** country wealth (rich countries → more chocolate and more investment in science)

**Psychological Examples:**

1. **TV Viewing and Aggression:**
   - **Correlation:** TV viewing correlates with aggression
   - **Problem:** TV → aggression? Aggression → TV? Third variable?

2. **Social Media and Depression:**
   - **Correlation:** social media use correlates with depression
   - **Problem:** social media → depression? Depression → social media? Third variable?

3. **Physical Activity and Health:**
   - **Correlation:** physical activity correlates with health
   - **Problem:** activity → health? Health → activity? Third variable?

**How to Avoid Errors:**

1. **Do Not Draw Causation Conclusions from Correlation:**
   - Correlation does not prove causation
   - Always look for alternative explanations

2. **Account for Third Variable:**
   - Check possible third variables
   - Control them in research

3. **Account for Reverse Causation:**
   - Check direction of causation
   - Use temporal sequence

4. **Use Experiment When Possible:**
   - Experiment is best way to establish causation
   - When impossible — use Hill's criteria

**Literature:**
- **Tyler Vigen, "Spurious Correlations"** (2015, English)
  - Collection of examples of spurious correlations
- **Steven Levitt, Stephen Dubner, "Freakonomics"** (2005, English, Russian trans. 2007)
  - Examples of correlations and causation

   - Can causation conclusion be drawn?
   - What alternative explanations are possible?

2. Find an example of spurious correlation and explain:
   - Why is this a spurious correlation?
   - What is the third variable?
   - How could causation be established?

3. Using Hill's criteria, evaluate causation in a specific study:
   - Which criteria are applicable?
   - How convincing is causation?
   - What are limitations?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Hill's work "The Environment and Disease" — this is a classic work on criteria of causation. Then study examples of spurious correlations (Vigen, Levitt and Dubner) — they well illustrate the problem.
