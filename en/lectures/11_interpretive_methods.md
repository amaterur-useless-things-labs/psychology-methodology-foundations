# Lecture 11: Interpretive Methods: Hermeneutics Lite™

## 1. Introduction

In psychology, especially in qualitative research and clinical practice, interpretive methods play an important role. Unlike explanation (explanation through cause), interpretation seeks to understand meaning, significance, context of an event.

How do interpretive methods work? What is the hermeneutic circle? How does interpretation differ from explanation? How to interpret psychological phenomena? These questions are important for psychology methodology, especially for qualitative research and clinical practice.

In this lecture, we will examine interpretive methods in psychology: the hermeneutic circle, differences between interpretation and explanation, application in psychoanalysis, phenomenology, narrative analysis, and problems of testability of interpretations.

**Lecture goal:** Understand how interpretive methods work, their difference from explanatory methods, and problems of their application in psychology.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Interpretation in Psychology

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, it is often necessary not just to explain an event (through cause), but to understand its meaning, significance, context. This is especially important for:
- Qualitative research: understanding experiences, meanings
- Clinical practice: understanding symptoms, behavior
- Cultural psychology: understanding cultural meanings

**The Problem of Difference:**

**Explanation:**
- Focus on cause: X causes Y
- Objectivity, testability
- Example: anxiety is caused by cognitive schemas

**Interpretation:**
- Focus on meaning: what does Y mean?
- Understanding, context
- Example: anxiety means fear of losing control

**The Problem of the Hermeneutic Circle:**

Interpretation creates a hermeneutic circle:
- Understanding of part depends on understanding of whole
- Understanding of whole depends on understanding of parts
- How to start interpretation without understanding whole?

**The Problem of Testability:**

Interpretation is subjective:
- Different interpreters can interpret differently
- How to test interpretation?
- Is objective interpretation possible?

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, interpretation is widely used:
- Psychoanalysis: interpretation of unconscious
- Phenomenology: interpretation of experiences
- Narrative analysis: interpretation of stories

But interpretation is problematic from scientific perspective:
- Subjective
- Difficult to test
- May be arbitrary

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand how interpretive methods work and their limitations.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Hermeneutic Circle: Understanding Part Through Whole

**What is the Hermeneutic Circle?**

Hermeneutic circle is circular dependence of understanding: understanding of part depends on understanding of whole, and understanding of whole depends on understanding of parts. This is a fundamental problem of interpretation.

**Classical Formulation:**

"To understand whole, need to understand parts; to understand parts, need to understand whole."

**Examples of Hermeneutic Circle:**

1. **Understanding Text:**
   - To understand sentence, need to understand text as whole
   - To understand text, need to understand sentences
   - But how to start without understanding whole?

2. **Understanding Behavior:**
   - To understand behavior, need to understand context
   - To understand context, need to understand behavior
   - But how to start without understanding context?

3. **Understanding Symptom:**
   - To understand symptom, need to understand symptom system
   - To understand system, need to understand symptoms
   - But how to start without understanding system?

**How to Break the Circle?**

Different approaches propose different solutions:

1. **Fore-understanding (Vorverständnis):**
   - Start with fore-understanding (preliminary understanding)
   - Fore-understanding is corrected in interpretation process
   - Example: start with general knowledge about person

2. **Iterative Process:**
   - Interpretation is iterative process
   - Understanding gradually refined
   - Example: first preliminary interpretation, then refinement

3. **Context:**
   - Context helps break circle
   - Example: cultural context helps understand behavior

**The Problem of Fore-understanding:**

Fore-understanding may be biased:
- Biases can distort interpretation
- How to avoid bias?
- How to test fore-understanding?

**Literature:**
- **Hans-Georg Gadamer, "Truth and Method"** (1960, German, Russian trans. 1988)
  - Classic work on hermeneutics and hermeneutic circle
- **Martin Heidegger, "Being and Time"** (1927, German, Russian trans. 1997)
  - On hermeneutic circle in understanding being
- **Friedrich Schleiermacher, "Hermeneutics"** (1838, German)
  - On hermeneutic circle in understanding texts

### 3.2. Interpretation vs. Explanation

**Main Difference:**

**Explanation (Erklärung):**
- **Goal:** explain why event occurs
- **Method:** establishing causes, laws
- **Focus:** cause, mechanism
- **Result:** causal explanation
- **Example:** anxiety is caused by cognitive schemas

**Interpretation (Verstehen):**
- **Goal:** understand what event means
- **Method:** understanding meaning, context
- **Focus:** meaning, significance
- **Result:** interpretation of meaning
- **Example:** anxiety means fear of losing control

**Characteristics of Explanation:**

1. **Causality:** explanation through cause (X → Y)

2. **Generalization:** explanation through general laws

3. **Objectivity:** explanation is objective (independent of interpreter)

4. **Testability:** explanation can be tested empirically

5. **Prediction:** explanation allows prediction

**Characteristics of Interpretation:**

1. **Meaning:** interpretation through meaning (what does it mean?)

2. **Individuality:** interpretation considers individual characteristics

3. **Subjectivity:** interpretation is subjective (depends on interpreter)

4. **Contextuality:** interpretation considers context

5. **Understanding:** interpretation gives understanding, not prediction

**The Problem of Difference:**

Can explanation and interpretation be strictly separated?
- Explanation may include interpretation
- Interpretation may include explanation
- Boundary is blurred

**Wilhelm Dilthey's Position:**

Dilthey separated sciences into:
- **Natural Sciences (Naturwissenschaften):** explanation (Erklärung)
- **Human Sciences (Geisteswissenschaften):** understanding (Verstehen)

But this separation is problematic:
- Psychology can use both approaches
- Boundary between explanation and understanding is blurred

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, both explanation and interpretation are used:
- **Explanation:** in experimental psychology, neuroscience
- **Interpretation:** in qualitative research, clinical practice

How to combine them? Are different methodologies needed?

**Literature:**
- **Wilhelm Dilthey, "Introduction to the Human Sciences"** (1883, German, Russian trans. 2000)
  - On difference between explanation and understanding
- **Carl Hempel, "Philosophy of Natural Science"** (1966, English, Russian trans. 1968)
  - Chapter 1: "Scientific Explanation" — on explanation

### 3.3. Application of Interpretive Methods in Psychology

**1. Psychoanalytic Interpretation**

**Main Principles:**

1. **Unconscious:** interpretation of unconscious processes
   - Example: interpretation of dreams, symptoms, slips

2. **Symbolism:** behavior as symbol of unconscious
   - Example: symptom symbolizes unacknowledged conflict

3. **Context:** interpretation in context of patient's history
   - Example: symptom interpreted in context of childhood experience

**Examples of Psychoanalytic Interpretation:**

1. **Interpretation of Symptom:**
   - **Symptom:** avoidance of public speaking
   - **Interpretation:** fear of judgment connected with unacknowledged fear of rejection by parents

2. **Interpretation of Dream:**
   - **Dream:** falling from height
   - **Interpretation:** fear of losing control, fear of failure

**Problems of Psychoanalytic Interpretation:**

1. **Subjectivity:** interpretation is subjective, depends on interpreter

2. **Testability:** difficult to test interpretation

3. **Arbitrariness:** interpretation may be arbitrary

4. **Confirmation:** interpretation may be distorted to confirm theory

**Literature:**
- **Sigmund Freud, "The Interpretation of Dreams"** (1900, German, Russian trans. 2007)
  - On psychoanalytic interpretation method
- **Sigmund Freud, "Psychopathology of Everyday Life"** (1901, German, Russian trans. 2007)
  - On interpretation of slips, errors

**2. Phenomenological Analysis**

**Main Principles:**

1. **Phenomenon:** studying phenomena of consciousness as given
   - Example: studying experience of fear as experienced

2. **Phenomenological Reduction:** suspension of judgments about reality
   - Example: do not ask if anxiety is real, but study experience itself

3. **Intentionality:** consciousness always directed at object
   - Example: fear is always fear of something

**Method of Phenomenological Analysis:**

1. **Data Collection:** description of experiences in their immediacy

2. **Phenomenological Reduction:** suspension of explanations

3. **Structure Description:** description of experience structures

4. **Interpretation:** interpretation of experience meanings

**Examples of Phenomenological Analysis:**

1. **Experience of Anxiety:**
   - **Description:** anxiety experienced as uncertainty, fear of unknown
   - **Structure:** intentionality (fear of something), temporality (expectation of future)
   - **Interpretation:** anxiety means openness of future, uncertainty of being

2. **Experience of Time:**
   - **Description:** time experienced differently in different situations
   - **Structure:** past, present, future as different modes of temporality
   - **Interpretation:** time is not objective, but subjectively experienced

**Problems of Phenomenological Analysis:**

1. **Subjectivity:** description depends on interpreter

2. **Testability:** difficult to test interpretation

3. **Generalization:** difficult to generalize results

**Literature:**
- **Edmund Husserl, "Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology"** (1913, German, Russian trans. 1999)
  - On method of phenomenological analysis
- **Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "Phenomenology of Perception"** (1945, French, Russian trans. 1999)
  - On application of phenomenology in psychology

**3. Narrative Analysis**

**Main Principles:**

1. **Narrative:** stories as way of organizing experience
   - Example: people organize their experience through stories

2. **Narrative Structure:** beginning, middle, end, plot
   - Example: life story has plot structure

3. **Interpretation:** interpretation of meanings in story
   - Example: what does story mean for teller?

**Method of Narrative Analysis:**

1. **Narrative Collection:** collecting stories (interviews, autobiographies, diaries)

2. **Structure Analysis:** analysis of narrative structure

3. **Theme Analysis:** analysis of themes, motifs

4. **Interpretation:** interpretation of meanings

**Examples of Narrative Analysis:**

1. **Recovery Story:**
   - **Narrative:** story about overcoming illness
   - **Structure:** problem → struggle → overcoming
   - **Interpretation:** story gives meaning to experience, survivor identity

2. **Professional Development Story:**
   - **Narrative:** career story
   - **Structure:** beginning → development → achievement
   - **Interpretation:** story organizes professional identity

**Problems of Narrative Analysis:**

1. **Construction:** narratives are constructed, do not reflect reality

2. **Interpretation:** interpretation depends on interpreter

3. **Testability:** difficult to test interpretation

**Literature:**
- **Jerome Bruner, "Actual Minds, Possible Worlds"** (1986, English, Russian trans. 2006)
  - On narrative in psychology
- **Dan McAdams, "The Stories We Live By"** (1993, English, Russian trans. 2006)
  - On narrative analysis in personality psychology

### 3.4. The Problem of Testability of Interpretations

**Main Problem:**

Interpretation is subjective — different interpreters can interpret differently. How to test interpretation?

**Problems of Testing:**

1. **Subjectivity of Interpreter:**
   - Interpretation depends on interpreter
   - Different interpreters can interpret differently
   - How to objectively test?

2. **Arbitrariness:**
   - Interpretation may be arbitrary
   - Can interpret differently
   - How to distinguish correct interpretation from incorrect?

3. **Confirmation:**
   - Interpretation may be distorted to confirm theory
   - How to avoid confirmation bias?

**Attempts at Solution:**

1. **Inter-rater Reliability:**
   - Several interpreters interpret independently
   - Agreement between interpreters increases reliability
   - Problem: agreement does not mean correctness

2. **Triangulation:**
   - Use of different methods to test interpretation
   - Example: interpretation tested through different data sources
   - Problem: different methods may give different results

3. **Quality Criteria:**
   - Quality criteria for interpretation (plausibility, consistency)
   - Example: interpretation should be plausible, consistent
   - Problem: criteria are subjective

4. **Member Checking:**
   - Checking interpretation by research participants
   - Example: show interpretation to participant, check agreement
   - Problem: participant may agree for different reasons

**The Problem of Objectivity:**

Is objective interpretation possible?
- Interpretation is always subjective
- But can minimize subjectivity
- Can make interpretation more justified

**Literature:**
- **Yvonna Lincoln, Egon Guba, "Naturalistic Inquiry"** (1985, English)
  - On quality criteria for interpretation
- **John Creswell, "Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design"** (2013, English, Russian trans. 2015)
  - On problems of testing interpretation

   - How does interpretation work?
   - What problems does interpretation have?
   - How can interpretation be tested?

2. Compare explanation and interpretation of one event:
   - How do they differ?
   - What does each approach give?
   - Can they be combined?

3. Practice interpretation:
   - Interpret a specific text, behavior, symptom
   - Describe interpretation process
   - Discuss interpretation problems

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Gadamer's work "Truth and Method" — this is a classic work on hermeneutics. Then study examples of interpretation in psychology (Freud — psychoanalysis, Husserl — phenomenology, Bruner — narrative).
