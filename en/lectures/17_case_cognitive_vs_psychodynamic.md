# Lecture 17: Case Study: Cognitive vs. Psychodynamic Interpretations of One Behavior

## 1. Introduction

Same psychological phenomena can be interpreted differently depending on theoretical position. Cognitive and psychodynamic approaches offer different interpretations of same events.

In this lecture, we will analyze a specific example of behavior from two positions — cognitive and psychodynamic — to understand how different theoretical approaches lead to different interpretations, and whether one can say that one interpretation is truer than another.

**Lecture goal:** Understand on a specific example differences between cognitive and psychodynamic interpretations, problems of choosing interpretation, and possibilities of integrating approaches.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Interpreting Behavior

**Why is this important?**

In psychology, same events can be interpreted differently depending on theoretical approach:
- **Cognitive Approach:** interprets through thoughts, beliefs, schemas
- **Psychodynamic Approach:** interprets through unconscious conflicts, defense mechanisms

How to choose correct interpretation? Can one say that one is truer than another? Can approaches be integrated?

**The Problem of Choosing Interpretation:**

**Position 1: One Interpretation is True**
- There is one correct interpretation
- Others are wrong
- Need to choose correct one

**Position 2: Multiple Interpretations are Valid**
- Different interpretations complement each other
- Each interpretation is valid in its context
- Interpretations can be integrated

**Position 3: Interpretations are Incommensurable**
- Different interpretations are incommensurable
- Cannot compare them objectively
- Need to choose based on other criteria

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, the problem is especially acute:
- Different approaches give different interpretations
- No objective criteria for choice
- How to choose correct interpretation?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand differences in interpretations and problems of choice.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. Case Study: Avoidance of Public Speaking

**Behavior Description:**

Patient (let's call him Alex) avoids public speaking. When he needs to speak before a group of people, he experiences strong anxiety, trembling, sweating, rapid heartbeat. He begins to avoid situations where public speaking may be required, refuses opportunities for advancement at work that require public presentations. This affects his career and social life.

**Additional Information:**

- Alex was a shy child in childhood
- At school he was sometimes teased for his answers before class
- Parents were critical of his achievements
- Currently he is successful in work where public speaking is not required
- He himself realizes that avoidance hinders his development

### 3.2. Cognitive Interpretation

**Main Principles of Cognitive Approach:**

1. **Focus on Thoughts:** behavior explained through thoughts, beliefs, schemas
2. **Consciousness:** thoughts can be conscious
3. **Changeability:** thoughts can be changed through cognitive techniques

**Cognitive Interpretation of Behavior:**

**1. Cognitive Schemas:**

**Negative Schemas About Self:**
- "I am incompetent in public speaking"
- "I will look stupid"
- "People will criticize me"
- "I will fail"

**Negative Schemas About Others:**
- "People will judge me strictly"
- "People will notice my mistakes"
- "People will not listen to me"

**Negative Schemas About World:**
- "Public speaking is dangerous"
- "Cannot make mistakes before audience"

**2. Cognitive Errors:**

**Catastrophization:**
- "If I speak, catastrophe will happen"
- "Everything will be terrible"

**Black-and-White Thinking:**
- "I will either speak perfectly or fail"
- "No middle option"

**Mind Reading:**
- "I know people think badly of me"
- "They consider me incompetent"

**Exaggeration of Negative:**
- Exaggeration of consequences of error
- Exaggeration of audience reaction

**3. Mechanism:**

```
Trigger (public speaking situation)
  ↓
Activation of negative schemas
  ↓
Catastrophic thoughts
  ↓
Anxiety (physical symptoms)
  ↓
Avoidance behavior
  ↓
Short-term relief
  ↓
Reinforcement of avoidance
```

**4. Therapy Goal:**

- Identify negative schemas and cognitive errors
- Challenge negative thoughts
- Develop more realistic beliefs
- Change behavior through cognitive restructuring

**Techniques:**
- Cognitive restructuring
- Exposure therapy
- Homework assignments

**Literature:**
- **Aaron Beck, "Anxiety Disorders and Phobias: A Cognitive Perspective"** (1985, English, Russian trans. 2006)
  - On cognitive interpretation of anxiety

### 3.3. Psychodynamic Interpretation

**Main Principles of Psychodynamic Approach:**

1. **Focus on Unconscious:** behavior explained through unconscious processes
2. **Infantile Conflicts:** conflicts from childhood influence present
3. **Defense Mechanisms:** unconscious strategies for protection from anxiety

**Psychodynamic Interpretation of Behavior:**

**1. Unconscious Conflicts:**

**Conflict Between Desire and Fear:**
- **Desire:** desire to be noticed, recognized, approved
- **Fear:** fear of judgment, criticism, rejection

**Infantile Roots:**
- **Early Experience:** critical parents, childhood experience of rejection
- **Internalization:** internalization of critical parent
- **Internal Critic:** unconscious internal critic

**2. Defense Mechanisms:**

**Avoidance:**
- Protection from unconscious conflict
- Avoidance of situation that activates conflict

**Repression:**
- Repression of desire to be noticed
- Repression of fear of rejection

**Projection:**
- Projection of own criticism onto others
- "They will criticize me" = "I criticize myself"

**Regression:**
- Regression to childhood state (shyness)
- Return to childish ways of protection

**3. Mechanism:**

```
Unconscious desire to be recognized
  ↓
Conflict with unconscious fear of rejection
  ↓
Activation of internal critic
  ↓
Defense mechanisms (avoidance)
  ↓
Symptom (avoidance of public speaking)
  ↓
Symbolic meaning (avoidance of situation where can be rejected)
```

**4. Therapy Goal:**

- Identify unconscious conflicts
- Work with transference
- Interpret defense mechanisms
- Integrate repressed parts of personality

**Techniques:**
- Interpretation of unconscious
- Analysis of transference
- Free associations
- Work with dreams

**Literature:**
- **Sigmund Freud, "Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis"** (1917, German, Russian trans. 1989)
  - On psychodynamic interpretation

### 3.4. Comparison of Interpretations

**Main Differences:**

| Characteristic | Cognitive Interpretation | Psychodynamic Interpretation |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Focus** | Thoughts, beliefs | Unconscious conflicts |
| **Level of Awareness** | Conscious | Unconscious |
| **Cause** | Negative schemas, cognitive errors | Unconscious conflicts, defense mechanisms |
| **Mechanism** | Thoughts → emotions → behavior | Conflict → defense → symptom |
| **Origin** | Acquired beliefs | Infantile conflicts |
| **Therapy Goal** | Change thoughts | Resolve conflicts, integrate repressed |
| **Methods** | Cognitive restructuring | Interpretation, analysis of transference |

**Similarities:**

1. **Anxiety as Key Symptom:**
   - Both approaches recognize anxiety as central symptom
   - Both seek to reduce anxiety

2. **Avoidance as Mechanism:**
   - Both approaches recognize avoidance as main mechanism
   - Both seek to reduce avoidance

3. **Importance of Early Experience:**
   - Both approaches recognize importance of early experience
   - Though interpret its role differently

**Differences:**

1. **Level of Awareness:**
   - **Cognitive:** focus on conscious thoughts
   - **Psychodynamic:** focus on unconscious

2. **Mechanism:**
   - **Cognitive:** thoughts cause behavior
   - **Psychodynamic:** conflict causes symptom

3. **Therapy Goal:**
   - **Cognitive:** change thoughts
   - **Psychodynamic:** resolve conflicts

### 3.5. Can One Say That One Interpretation is Truer Than Another?

**The Problem of Truth:**

**Position 1: One Interpretation is True**
- One interpretation corresponds to reality
- Other is wrong
- But how to determine which is true?

**Problem:**
- No objective criteria
- Different approaches use different criteria
- How to test which interpretation is true?

**Position 2: Both Interpretations are Valid**
- Both interpretations are valid in their frameworks
- Each interpretation describes different aspects
- Interpretations can be integrated

**Problem:**
- How to integrate different interpretations?
- Do they contradict each other?
- How to combine conscious and unconscious?

**Position 3: Interpretations are Incommensurable**
- Interpretations based on different paradigms
- Cannot compare them objectively
- Need to choose based on other criteria (effectiveness, agreement)

**Problem:**
- On what criteria to base choice?
- How to evaluate effectiveness?
- How to achieve agreement?

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Effectiveness:**
   - Which interpretation leads to more effective therapy?
   - Problem: how to measure effectiveness?

2. **Empirical Support:**
   - Which interpretation has more empirical support?
   - Problem: different approaches use different methods

3. **Explanatory Power:**
   - Which interpretation better explains behavior?
   - Problem: how to evaluate explanatory power?

4. **Parsimony:**
   - Which interpretation is simpler?
   - Problem: simplicity does not mean truth

5. **Community Agreement:**
   - Which interpretation does community agree with?
   - Problem: agreement does not mean truth

**The Problem of Choice:**

Choice of interpretation cannot be purely objective:
- Depends on theoretical position
- Depends on evaluation criteria
- Depends on context

**Literature:**
- **Adolf Grünbaum, "The Foundations of Psychoanalysis"** (1984, English)
  - On problem of testing psychoanalytic interpretations

### 3.6. Can Approaches be Integrated?

**The Problem of Integration:**

**Position 1: Integration is Possible**
- Cognitive and psychodynamic approaches can be integrated
- Conscious and unconscious complement each other
- Example: cognitive-psychodynamic therapy

**Problem:**
- How to integrate different paradigms?
- Do they contradict each other?

**Position 2: Integration is Impossible**
- Cognitive and psychodynamic approaches are incompatible
- Different ontologies (conscious vs. unconscious)
- Different epistemologies (experiment vs. interpretation)

**Problem:**
- But practice shows integration is possible
- Different techniques can complement each other

**Attempts at Integration:**

**1. Cognitive-Psychodynamic Therapy:**
- Combining cognitive techniques with psychodynamic interpretations
- Example: working with cognitive schemas and unconscious conflicts simultaneously

**2. Integrative Psychotherapy:**
- Use of techniques from different approaches depending on client needs
- Example: cognitive techniques for working with thoughts, psychodynamic for working with conflicts

**The Problem of Integration:**

Integration may be eclecticism, not true integration:
- Mechanical use of techniques from different approaches
- No unified theory explaining when to use what
- How to avoid eclecticism?

**Literature:**
- **John Norcross, Michael Goldfried, "Handbook of Psychotherapy Integration"** (2005, English)
  - On integration of cognitive and psychodynamic approaches

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose specific behavior and interpret it from two positions:
   - Cognitive interpretation
   - Psychodynamic interpretation
   - Compare interpretations

2. Analyze problem of choosing interpretation:
   - On what criteria to base choice?
   - How to evaluate effectiveness?
   - Can several interpretations be used?

3. Develop plan for integrating approaches:
   - How to integrate cognitive and psychodynamic approaches?
   - What techniques to use?
   - How to avoid eclecticism?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Beck's work "Anxiety Disorders and Phobias" — this is a classic work on cognitive interpretation. Then study Freud's work "Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis" — this is a classic work on psychodynamic interpretation. Then consider attempts at integration (Norcross and Goldfried) — they show how to integrate approaches.
