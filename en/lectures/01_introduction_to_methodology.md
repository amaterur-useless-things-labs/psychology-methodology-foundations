# Lecture 1: Introduction to Psychology Methodology

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the course "Methodological Foundations of Psychology: Scientific Version". This course is dedicated to the foundations on which stands the building of psychology — a building where everyone argues whether it is a building at all.

**Why is this course important?**

Psychology is a unique discipline. It claims scientific status but constantly faces questions: Can we objectively study the subjective? Is psychology a science or something else? Why are there so many competing approaches in psychology? Why are the same phenomena explained differently?

Methodology is not just a set of methods and research techniques. It is an awareness of *how* we obtain knowledge, *on what grounds* we consider something scientific, and *what limitations* are inherent in our knowledge. Methodology is the foundation of critical thinking in science.

**What will we study?**

We will journey from fundamental questions about what makes science a science to specific problems of modern psychological research. We will examine:

- Criteria of scientificity and their applicability to psychology
- Structure of scientific knowledge: from phenomenon to theory
- Diversity of methods and their limitations
- Epistemological foundations of various approaches
- Place of psychology among other sciences
- Ethical and methodological challenges of modern psychology

**Course goal:** Learn to see the methodological anatomy of psychological research and theories, understand their foundations and limitations, think critically about scientific knowledge.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Why is psychology methodology problematic?

Psychology is in a unique position among sciences. Let's consider several key problems:

**Problem of the object of study**

Psychology studies humans — beings who:
- Actively react to research (Hawthorne effect, experimenter effect)
- Are aware that they are being studied (reflexivity)
- Change over time and context
- Have subjective inner experience that is not directly observable

This creates fundamental methodological problems that do not exist in natural sciences. Can we apply the same criteria of scientificity to such an object as we do to physical objects?

**Problem of multiplicity of approaches**

In physics, there are dominant paradigms that periodically change. In psychology, fundamentally different approaches coexist simultaneously:
- Behaviorism (behavior is determined by environment)
- Cognitivism (mind as information processing)
- Psychoanalysis (unconscious determines behavior)
- Cultural-historical approach (mind is social in origin)

Is this simply eclecticism or does methodological pluralism have foundations?

**Problem of criteria of scientificity**

Classical criteria of scientificity (Popper's falsifiability, verification) are poorly applicable to many psychological theories:
- Can we falsify a psychoanalytic interpretation?
- How do we verify a theory about the unconscious?
- What to do with theories that are useful in practice but poorly amenable to empirical verification?

**Problem of reproducibility**

The replication crisis in psychology (2010s) showed that many classical studies do not replicate. Is this a methodological problem or a feature of psychology as a science?

**Problem of integration**

Is a unified theory in psychology possible? Or is psychology inherently pluralistic? Is integration needed or can we manage with methodological pluralism?

These problems do not have simple answers. The task of the course is not to find the "right" answer, but to learn to think methodologically, see problems, and understand the foundations on which various approaches are built.

## 3. Main Thoughts and Ideas

### 3.1. What is methodology?

**Methodology vs. methods**

It is important to distinguish:
- **Methods** — specific techniques for data collection (experiment, survey, observation, interview)
- **Methodology** — philosophy of science, justification of method choice, epistemological foundations of research

Methodology answers questions:
- *Why* do we choose this method and not another?
- *On what grounds* do we consider this knowledge?
- *What limitations* are inherent in our approach?
- *How are* theory, method, and data related?

**Literature:**
- **John Stuart Mill, "A System of Logic"** (1843) — classical work on methodology of sciences. Book VI, Chapter 5: "On the Methods of Social Sciences"
- **Karl Popper, "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"** (1934) — introduction, chapters 1-2 on the demarcation problem
- **Thomas Kuhn, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"** (1962) — chapter 1: "The Role of Normal Science"

### 3.2. Methodology as critical thinking

Methodology is not a set of rules, but a way of critical thinking about scientific knowledge:

**Critical analysis of research:**
1. What assumptions is the research based on?
2. What methods are used and why?
3. How are theory and data related?
4. What limitations does the approach have?
5. Can results be generalized?

**Critical analysis of theory:**
1. What assumptions underlie the theory?
2. How can the theory be tested?
3. What alternative explanations are possible?
4. What phenomena can the theory not explain?

**Literature:**
- **Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes"** (1970) — introduction on critical evaluation of theories
- **Stephen Toulmin, "Human Understanding"** (1972) — on development and critique of conceptual structures

### 3.3. Specificity of psychology as an object of methodological analysis

**Multi-level nature of psychological analysis:**

Psychological phenomena can be studied at different levels:
- **Neurobiological:** neurons, neurotransmitters, brain systems
- **Cognitive:** information processing, schemas, models
- **Personality:** traits, motives, identity
- **Social:** roles, norms, interaction
- **Cultural:** values, practices, discourses

Each level requires different methods and has different validity criteria. Problem: how to link these levels? Can we reduce one level to another?

**Literature:**
- **David Marr, "Vision"** (1982) — chapter 1 on three levels of explanation (computational, algorithmic, physical)
- **Jerry Fodor, "The Modularity of Mind"** (1983) — chapter 1 on multi-level nature of cognitive analysis
- **Lev Vygotsky, "History of the Development of Higher Mental Functions"** (1931) — on social and individual levels

**Problem of subjectivity:**

Psychology studies subjective experience, which:
- Is not directly observable by others
- Cannot be fully conveyed through language
- Depends on cultural and historical context
- Can change during research

How to do science about subjectivity? This is a philosophical problem that has methodological consequences.

**Literature:**
- **Edmund Husserl, "Ideas for a Pure Phenomenology"** (1913) — chapters 1-2 on subjective experience
- **Thomas Nagel, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"** (1974) — classic article on the problem of subjectivity
- **Francisco Varela, "Neurophenomenology"** (1996) — attempt to integrate first and third person

## 4. Conclusions

**Key ideas of the lecture:**

1. **Methodology** — is not just methods, but philosophy of science, awareness of foundations and limitations of knowledge.

2. **Psychology** is in a unique methodological position:
   - Complex and active object of study
   - Multiplicity of competing approaches
   - Problems with criteria of scientificity
   - Multi-level analysis

3. **Methodological thinking** — is critical analysis:
   - Of foundations of research and theories
   - Of connection between theory, method, and data
   - Of limitations of approaches

4. **The task of the course** — is not to find "correct" answers, but to learn:
   - To see methodological problems
   - To understand foundations of various approaches
   - To critically evaluate research and theories

**Methodology is the foundation of professional thinking for a psychologist.** Without understanding methodological foundations, it is impossible to:
- Critically evaluate research
- Choose adequate methods
- Understand limitations of knowledge
- Develop psychology as a science

## 5. Problems

**Open questions and discussions:**

1. **Is psychology a science?**
   - Position 1: Yes, but with special methods
   - Position 2: Partially, some areas are scientific
   - Position 3: No, it is another form of knowledge

2. **Can we objectively study the subjective?**
   - Through self-reports and interpretation?
   - Through objective correlates?
   - Or is subjectivity fundamentally non-scientific?

3. **Is a unified theory in psychology needed?**
   - Is methodological pluralism a strength or weakness?
   - Can we integrate incompatible paradigms?

4. **How are levels of analysis related?**
   - Can we reduce psychology to biology?
   - How to link neuro-, cognitive, and social levels?

**These questions do not have simple answers.** The goal of the course is not to solve them, but to learn to think about them methodologically, to understand the foundations of various positions.

**Practical problems:**

- Replication crisis: how to ensure reproducibility?
- Ethical limitations: what can and cannot be studied?
- Publication bias: how to ensure scientific honesty?
- Application of knowledge: what responsibility do psychologists have?

## Additional Materials for Independent Study

**Questions for reflection:**

1. What makes science a science? Provide examples from psychology and other sciences.

2. What is the specificity of psychology as a science? What prevents it from being a "pure" science?

3. How do you understand the difference between methods and methodology? Provide examples.

4. What methodological problems do you see in psychological research you are familiar with?

**Practical assignment:**

Read any psychological article and try to answer:
- What assumptions is the research based on?
- Why were these particular methods used?
- How do the authors link theory and data?
- What limitations does the research have?

This exercise will help develop methodological thinking.
