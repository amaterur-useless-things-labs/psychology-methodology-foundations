# Lecture 24: Interdisciplinarity: Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Psycholinguistics

## 1. Introduction

Psychology increasingly becomes interdisciplinary, intersecting with other sciences: linguistics, biology, philosophy, artificial intelligence. How do interdisciplinary areas work? What are advantages and problems of interdisciplinarity?

In this lecture, we will examine interdisciplinarity in psychology: cognitive science (psychology + linguistics + philosophy + AI), neuroscience (psychology + biology + medicine), psycholinguistics (psychology + linguistics), and interaction of psychology with AI.

**Lecture goal:** Understand role of interdisciplinarity in psychology, advantages and problems of interdisciplinary areas.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem of Interdisciplinarity

**Why is this important?**

Psychology increasingly becomes interdisciplinary:
- Cognitive science unites psychology, linguistics, philosophy, AI
- Neuroscience unites psychology, biology, medicine
- Psycholinguistics unites psychology and linguistics

How does this influence psychology? What are advantages and problems?

**The Problem of Boundaries:**

**Position 1: Boundaries Blur**
- Interdisciplinarity blurs boundaries between sciences
- Identity of disciplines is lost
- Example: where does psychology end and neuroscience begin?

**Position 2: Boundaries Remain**
- Interdisciplinarity does not blur boundaries
- Disciplines preserve identity
- Example: psychology remains psychology, but collaborates with others

**Position 3: Boundaries Not Important**
- Boundaries are artificial
- Problems are important, not disciplines
- Example: solve problems, not worrying about boundaries

**The Problem in Psychology:**

In psychology, interdisciplinarity is widely spread:
- Many areas are interdisciplinary
- Boundaries are blurred
- How to preserve identity of psychology?

**These problems do not have simple answers.** Different approaches solve them differently. It is important to understand role of interdisciplinarity and its limitations.

### Practical Assignments

1. Choose interdisciplinary area and analyze:
   - Which disciplines intersect?
   - How do they interact?
   - What are advantages and problems?

2. Analyze interdisciplinary research:
   - Which disciplines are used?
   - How are they integrated?
   - What problems are there?

3. Develop plan for interdisciplinary research:
   - Which disciplines to use?
   - How to integrate them?
   - What problems need to be solved?

**Recommendation:** Start by reading Miller's work "The Cognitive Revolution" — this is a good introduction to cognitive science. Then study specific interdisciplinary areas (Kandel on neuroscience, Chomsky on psycholinguistics, Newell and Simon on AI) — they show how interdisciplinary areas work.
